But not horribly painful. you get used to them and they become easier to talk with. the pain is only when they get tightened and until you get used to them. They give you wax to put around the spots that hurt you when your tongue rubs against the brackets and you won't feel the pain. They hurt for a bit when you first get them.They feel tight.Then, they settle down. However, they hurt each time you get them adjusted for a few days afterward. But,dont worry,you'll get used to the pain. yes yes they hurt when u first get them but then u get used 2 them really  easily. sometimes u like drool or spit or something but unless u have a pallete expander u can talk normal. if u have 1 ur \"K's\" get all screwed up. Yes THEy HuRt WhEn YoU fIrSt GeT them but just for a few days...If you eat something hard and it gets stuck in them it mite hurt...and also after youy get them tightened..but they do not make it hard to talk, only retainers do that!!! at the begining you feel really weird and it hurts a little bit but then you get used to them\nis not hard to talk at all you can talk normally I had them...they hurt for a bit when you first get them...feel tight.  then, they settle down.  However, they hurt each time you get them adjusted for a few days afterward. I just got my braces a few days ago. They felt like they were loose for the first two days, and it was really hard to eat. I got over speaking difficulties quickly, although the inside of your mouth gets kind of scratched and torn- don't fret, it heals quickly enough. After that you get calouses, so it doesn't hurt anymore. I think the pain felt depends on how old you are when you get them, what kind of treatment you are getting, and how severe your bite is. Lately, I've forgotten I'd had them on. You get used to them. Intially they are painful...also depending on your age and the condition your teeth are in. I have had my for almost 2 1/2 years and my first year was painful. Now I forget I have them...they are coming off soon and I can't wait! I recommend Aleve, its really helpful in relieving the pain.",
        "summary": "The various experiences with braces are shared, with some individuals describing initial pain and discomfort, especially during adjustments or the first few days after getting them. However, a common theme emerges that people tend to get used to the discomfort over time. The pain is often associated with tightness, difficulty eating, and potential challenges in speaking initially. Some mention the use of wax to alleviate pain caused by friction with brackets. Despite the initial challenges, many report adapting quickly and experiencing less discomfort as time goes on. The experiences also highlight that age, the specific treatment plan, and the severity of the dental issues can influence the level of discomfort. Ultimately, several individuals express that the pain diminishes over time, and they become accustomed to having braces.",

When the baby was in the womb, the mother's liver took care of the excess pigment (called bilirubin) in the blood that causes jaundice. It takes a while for the baby's liver to be able to process and eliminate it. \n\nMild cases can be treated by exposing baby briefly to sunlight and making sure baby is getting plenty of fluids (breastmilk is best).  More severe cases can be treated by your pediatrician using special light therapy. What is jaundice? \nJaundice is an illness that can happen in the first few days of a baby's life. It turns your baby's skin, eyes and mouth a yellow color. The yellow color is caused by bilirubin.\n\nBilirubin is made when the body breaks down old red blood cells. This is a normal process that happens all through life. Bilirubin goes to the liver, where it is changed again. Then it goes into the intestines and the kidneys, and then it goes out of the body. If too much bilirubin builds up in your baby's body, it makes a yellow color called jaundice (say: \"john-diss\").\n\nJaundice is common in babies and is usually not serious.\n\nWhy do some babies get jaundice? \nRed blood cells have a shorter life in babies than they do in adults. This means more bilirubin goes through your baby's liver. If your baby's skin is bruised during birth, more red cells may need to be broken down. Then your baby's liver has to handle even more bilirubin. Sometimes a baby's liver is not mature enough to handle the extra bilirubin.\n\n\nHow can I tell if my baby has jaundice? \nYou should watch for color changes in your baby's skin. You should also check the whites of your baby's eyes and the pink skin inside your baby's mouth. If they get yellowish, you may want to see your baby's doctor. If your baby has pale skin, it should look white when you gently press it with your fingertips. If the skin looks yellow, your baby may have jaundice. If your baby has darker skin, it may be harder to check, except by looking at your baby's eyes and inside your baby's mouth.\n\nArtificial light, especially fluorescent lights, can sometimes fool your eyes into seeing a yellow color that is not really there. So you might want to check your baby in daylight in a sunny room.\n\nAs the amount of bilirubin in the blood increases, your baby's body will get more yellow. As the bilirubin level rises, the yellow color can move from your baby's head down to the chest and even down to the toes.\n\nIf your baby's skin is yellow, see your baby's doctor right away. The doctor will take a small amount of your baby's blood and measure the bilirubin in it.\n\n\nHow is jaundice treated? \nIf the bilirubin level is not too high, your baby might not need any treatment. Your doctor might just want you to feed your baby breast milk or formula more often.\n\nIf the bilirubin level is very high or is getting higher very quickly, your baby will need light therapy. This is also called phototherapy. Phototherapy helps to break down bilirubin in your baby's skin.\n\nFor this treatment, your baby is placed under special white, blue or green lights. The baby might also be placed on a special light-producing blanket. Your baby's eyes are covered to protect them from the bright lights. Phototherapy usually lasts for 1 or 2 days.\n\nPhototherapy can give your baby loose stools, temperature problems or dehydration. Your doctor will watch your baby carefully to prevent or treat these problems.\n\nIf your baby's bilirubin level gets too high, and phototherapy does not work well enough, the baby might need an exchange transfusion. In this treatment, some of your baby's blood is taken out, and it is replaced with blood from someone else.\n\n\nCan jaundice hurt my baby? \nJaundice is not a serious problem in most healthy babies. However, very high bilirubin levels can be dangerous. It can give some babies brain damage.\n\nYour doctor will measure your baby's bilirubin level a number of times. If necessary, your baby will be treated. This usually keeps the bilirubin level from getting high enough to hurt your baby.\n\n \n\nHow long will my baby have jaundice? \nJaundice lasts for a different time in different babies. Often, the bilirubin level goes up for the first 3 to 4 days and then slowly goes back down. A baby who is breastfed may have mild jaundice for a longer time than a baby who is formula-fed.",

Jaundice is usually not serious, but very high bilirubin levels can be dangerous, potentially causing brain damage. Monitoring bilirubin levels and appropriate treatment help prevent complications.

What are the differences between bipolar I and bipolar II disorders? \n\nBipolar I disorder is characterized by episodes of mania that alternate with periods of depression or periods in which individuals have simultaneously occurring manic and depressive symptoms called mixed states. In contrast, bipolar II disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of depression and milder symptoms of mania, called hypomania. Hypomanic episodes typically do not impair an individual's ability to function to the extent that full-blown manic episodes do additionally; hypomanic episodes are not complicated by psychotic symptoms. \n\n3. What is rapid cycling? \n\nThe term rapid cycling was originally coined by David Dunner, M.D., and Ron Fieve, M.D., in the 1970s when they identified a group of individuals who did not respond well to lithium. These patients typically had four or more episodes of mania or depression in the 12-month interval prior to lithium treatment. This definition has been adopted formally by DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed.) and specifically means the occurrence of four or more mood episodes within the preceding year. In severe cases, rapid cycling can occur even within a one-day period. \n\n4. At what age does bipolar disorder appear? \n\nBipolar disorder most commonly presents in the late teens and early 20s. Unfortunately, for most individuals, lifelong treatment may be required to prevent recurrent manic and depressive episodes. Equally unfortunate is evidence that the illness often goes undiagnosed and untreated for many years; the longer the illness progresses without treatment, the greater the impairment in an individual's psychological, educational and vocational development. Additionally, untreated bipolar disorder carries a high risk of suicide. \n\n5. Is bipolar disorder genetic? \n\nBipolar disorder, among all psychiatric illnesses, may have the greatest genetic contribution. For instance, if an individual has a parent with bipolar disorder, the chance that the individual's child will have bipolar disorder is about nine-fold greater than in the general population, with the risk rising from about 1% to about 10%. The inheritability of this illness is estimated to be anywhere from 50% to 80%. On the other hand, if a person with bipolar disorder is thinking about having children, there are still good odds that the child will not have bipolar illness. So the genetic determinants of the illness are complicated. \n\n6. How is bipolar disorder treated? \n\nThe cornerstone of treatment is medications that treat acute manic, depressive or mixed episodes, and which, in the long run, attempt to prevent the recurrence of these episodes. Such medications include lithium, divalproex (Depakote) and, more recently, some of the atypical antipsychotics as well as antidepressants. \n\nPsychotherapy plays an important role in improving the course and outcome of this illness in people. In particular, those with bipolar disorder often have strained relationships with loved ones because of their experiences during manic or depressive episodes; psychotherapy can help repair these torn relationships. In addition, psychotherapy can educate people about the signs and symptoms of their illness, how to pay attention to warning signs and how to nip emerging episodes in the bud. Psychotherapy can also help individuals cope with the stress that can sometimes precipitate manic or depressive episodes. \n\n7. What med I also know and am close to someone with said disease.

        "input": "summarize as INFORMATION: what is Fifth Disease? It is a infectious disease-mostly kids get--with a rash on feet, hands and mouth--it goes away in about 14 days--no big deal What is \"fifth disease?\"\n\nFifth disease is a mild rash illness that occurs most commonly in children. The ill child typically has a \"slapped-cheek\" rash on the face and a lacy red rash on the trunk and limbs. Occasionally, the rash may itch. An ill child may have a low-grade fever, malaise, or a \"cold\" a few days before the rash breaks out. The child is usually not very ill, and the rash resolves in 7 to 10 days.\n\nWhat causes fifth disease?\n\nFifth disease is caused by infection with human parvovirus B19. This virus infects only humans. Pet dogs or cats may be immunized against \"parvovirus,\" but these are animal parvoviruses that do not infect humans. Therefore, a child cannot \"catch\" parvovirus from a pet dog or cat, and a pet cat or dog cannot catch human parvovirus B19 from an ill child.\n\nCan adults get fifth disease?\n\nYes, they can. An adult who is not immune can be infected with parvovirus B19 and either have no symptoms or develop the typical rash of fifth disease, joint pain or swelling, or both. Usually, joints on both sides of the body are affected. The joints most frequently affected are the hands, wrists, and knees. The joint pain and swelling usually resolve in a week or two, but they may last several months. About 50% of adults, however, have been previously infected with parvovirus B19, have developed immunity to the virus, and cannot get fifth disease.\n\nIs fifth disease contagious?\n\nYes. A person infected with parvovirus B19 is contagious during the early part of the illness, before the rash appears. By the time a child has the characteristic \"slapped cheek\" rash of fifth disease, for example, he or she is probably no longer contagious and may return to school or child care center. This contagious period is different than that for many other rash illnesses, such as measles, for which the child is contagious while he or she has the rash.\n\nHow does someone get infected with parvovirus B19?\n\nParvovirus B19 has been found in the respiratory secretions (e.g., saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus) of infected persons before the onset of rash, when they appear to \"just have a cold.\" The virus is probably spread from person to person by direct contact with those secretions, such as sharing drinking cups or utensils. In a household, as many as 50% of susceptible persons exposed to a family member who has fifth disease may become infected. During school outbreaks, 10% to 60% of students may get fifth disease.\n\nHow soon after infection with parvovirus B19 does a person become ill?\n\nA susceptible person usually becomes ill 4 to 14 days after being infected with the virus, but may become ill for as long as 20 days after infection.\n\nDoes everyone who is infected with parvovirus B19 become ill?\n\nNo. During outbreaks of fifth disease, about 20% of adults and children who are infected with parvovirus B19 do not develop any symptoms. Furthermore, other persons infected with the virus will have a non-specific illness that is not characteristic of fifth disease. Persons infected with the virus, however, do develop lasting immunity that protects them against infection in the future.\n\nHow is fifth disease diagnosed?\n\nA physician can often diagnose fifth disease by seeing the typical rash during a physical examination. In cases in which it is important to confirm the diagnosis, a blood test may be done to look for antibodies to parvovirus. Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system in response to parvovirus B19 and other germs. If immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody to parvovirus B19 is detected, the test result suggests that the person has had a recent infection.\n\nIs fifth disease serious?\n\nFifth disease is usually a mild illness that resolves on its own among children and adults who are otherwise healthy. Joint pain and swelling in adults usually resolve without long-term disability.\n\nParvovirus B19 infection may cause a serious",

A hiccup or hiccough (generally pronounced \"hiccup\" independent of the spelling) is an involuntary spasm of the diaphragm; typically this repeats several times a minute.

A bout of hiccups generally resolves by itself, although many home remedies are in circulation to shorten the duration, and medication is occasionally necessary. By extension, the term \"hiccup\" is also used to describe a small and unrepeated aberration in an otherwise consistent pattern. The medical term is singultus.\n\nWhile many cases develop spontaneously, hiccups are known to develop often in specific situations, such as eating too quickly, taking a cold drink while eating a hot meal, eating very hot or spicy food, laughing vigorously or coughing, or drinking an excess of an alcoholic beverage. Hiccups may be caused by pressure to the phrenic nerve by other anatomical structures, or rarely by tumors. Irrition to your diaphragm causes hiccups. \n\nThe diaphragn pulls down when you inhale to help pull air into the lungs, and it pushes up when you exhale to help push air out of the lungs. \n\nBut when your diaphragm gets irritated it pushes up in a jerky way causing a hiccup. Hiccups are sudden, involuntary contractions of the diaphragm muscle. As the muscle contracts repeatedly, the opening between your vocal cords snaps shut to check the inflow of air and makes the hiccup sound.

Since then, it was not detected when I had physicals.  I know many people who were diagnosed with them and they were nothing.\n\nHere's some info from webmd:\n\n\nIn particular, they occur in many healthy children, who may or may not outgrow them as adults. They may also occur during pregnancy. Such murmurs are called \"innocent\" heart murmurs. They are not associated with medical or heart conditions, and do not require treatment or lifestyle changes.\n\n\nThough many murmurs are innocent, some may indicate serious heart problems. For instance, heart murmurs may be caused by blood flowing through a heart valve made leaky or narrow by disease. Murmurs can also be caused by increased blood flow across a valve as a result of medical conditions such as anemia or hypothyroidism. Congenital cardiac defects (heart problems present at birth) can also cause heart murmurs. These often can be repaired with surgery.\n\nWithin the heart there are four chambers separated from each other by valves, or flaps, that regulate how much blood enters each chamber at any time. Healthy valves also help prevent blood from flowing in the wrong direction in your heart.\n\nA healthy heart makes a \"lub-dub\" sound as it beats. The \"lub\" (systolic sound) happens when part of the heart contracts and the mitral and tricuspid valves close, and the \"dub\" (diastolic sound) occurs when part of the heart relaxes and the aortic and pulmonic valves close. A heart murmur is an extra sound, such as a whooshing, in the heartbeat caused by irregular blood flow through the heart valves.\n\nHeart murmurs can be heard through a stethoscope and often are detected during routine physical examinations. On further examination, your doctor may find that the heart murmur is innocent. If your heart murmur is related to more serious heart problems, your doctor may refer you to a cardiologist (heart specialist). Medication or surgery may be recommended to treat the underlying problem. He or she may also suggest that you take extra precautions against getting a heart infection, such as by taking antibiotics when you have dental work or some surgeries. With thorough examination and proper tests, your doctor should be able to tell what causes your heart murmur.\n\nSymptoms\nMany people with heart murmurs experience no symptoms. However, some murmurs can occur in conjunction with these other symptoms:\n\n    * Chest pain\n    * Rapid heartbeat (palpitations)\n    * Breathlessness\n    * Fatigue\n    * Bluish skin color or fingertips (sometimes seen in babies with congenital heart defects) it is a hole in the heart murmur is the sound that appear when there is something that disturb the flow of blood when it pass through the valves of the heart It's a sound made as blood flows over a heart valve. Normal heart sounds don't make the \"whoosh\" that a murmur does. Diseased heart valves make eddy currents and so the \"whoosh\" is audible in the doctor's stethescope. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_murmur",
        "summary": "You personally received a diagnosis of a heart murmur a few years ago, but when checked by a cardiologist, it was deemed not concerning. Many people, including healthy children and pregnant individuals, may have \"innocent\" heart murmurs that do not require treatment. Some heart murmurs, however, can indicate serious heart problems, such as valve issues or congenital defects. The heart murmur is an extra sound, like a whooshing, caused by irregular blood flow through the heart valves. It can be detected during routine physical examinations and, if necessary, further examination by a cardiologist. Symptoms may include chest pain, rapid heartbeat, breathlessness, fatigue, and bluish skin color in some cases. A heart murmur could also be associated with a hole in the heart. Thorough examination and appropriate tests help determine the cause of the heart murmur, and treatment may involve medication, surgery, or precautions against infections.

You can also sit in a hot tub, try for the sauna action with all the steam. To make that even better, they have these tablets you put in the bottom of your shower that are full of eucalyptus or mentholatum, and that breaks it up too, just ask at your local pharmacy. Mint teas help soothe and release, and cayenne, horseradish, garlic and ginger all have things that work up into the sinuses to help stop the phlegm from running down the back of your throat, so as much as you can stomache in soup, etc works wonders. Don't smoke while you're phlegmy. And change your sheets! Any germs you have are harbored there more than anywhere! Stay out of the cold damp as much as possible, and good luck! I hope you feel better! Regular doses of cough syrup and LOTS of liquids.",

You might try a diet with low fat and very low saturated fats.  Reducing the saturated fats will lower blood cholesterol and may (I'm not promising anything!) make the stones smaller.\n\nLowering your total fat intake may also help reduce or prevent pain.  Gallstones hurt because when you eat fat, the stomach senses it and tells the gallbladder to release some of the gall into the intestines to help digest the fat.  If you have stones, that squeezing is about like squeezing a handfull of pointy rocks.\n\nHowever...   I've had the surgery and it really isn't a big deal.  There is minimal scarring and the incisions aren't that much bigger than a bug bite or a medium sized zit.  \n\nIf you leave the gallstones there, they can get large enough to damage the gallbladder, with the result of a bad infection and that can cause death, which is a very Bad Thing! They now have a way of zapping them with sound that caused them to shatter instead of operating.  I don't know the details though. If you really want to seek other alternatives I would look into finding a holistic store near you and maybe call and ask if they have any organic remedies.... usually a reg. doc. wont tell you those type of remedies because its not considered western medicine.... good luck Have you seen a gastroenterologist?  They can do a minimally invasive procedure called an ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography - try saying that 3 times fast!).  An ERCP won't get rid of the stones that are in the gallbladder...just the stones that are stuck in the duct leading from the GB to the small intestine.  They can make a tiny cut in the duct and pull gallstones out with a small balloon.  If the stone is too large, they have equipment that will crush the stone so it will pass freely.  \n\nI had the surgery myself about 10 years ago.  It's not as bad as you'd imagine, and you feel much better after it's over.  You might still have phantom pain for a while, but it's nowhere near as bad as the pain you started with.  \n\nEating a diet high in fat will make gallbladder disease worse, but you can't really get rid of the stones unless they pass naturally or you have them removed, either in surgery or with an ERCP. The best remedy is surgury. I had surgery to have kidney stones removed. The surgery isn't as bad as you think it may be.",

There was never enough resistance to get it.  I dont recommend any type of sit ups.  I do a kung fu style push up that gives you the best results.  Imagine, everybody can do like 10 or 20, maybe 100 sit ups, but with this, some cannot even do one.  But, just because you cant do one doesnt mean you havent done any work.  Eventually, after trying every day, you will be able to do one.  And then 2, 3, and slowly you work your way to like 25.  You only need to do about 15 to 20 per day to keep that 6 pack after its there.  You lay flat on the floor on your stomach.  Then you prop your feet up in push up position.  Now you put your hands out there on the floor.  Now put them together so that they are just touching.  Now, try to do a push up.  Keep your back as straight as possible.  When you first do this, your back will have a tendency to bend because you are trying to do at least one.  Hehe.  Um, I used to be able to do 50 of these easy.  After I get it, it was a cinch.

        "summary": "Bipolar disorder is explained as a chemical imbalance in the brain, with various life factors contributing to episodes, such as stress, sleep patterns, and alcohol consumption. The environment, especially a strong support system, plays a crucial role. The idea is raised that overcoming challenges may involve learning to manage them rather than completely getting over them. The permanence of neural pathways is acknowledged, suggesting that faults or challenges are integral to one's identity. The concept of creating new, positive neural pathways is proposed as a means of coping and leading a fulfilling life. The ability to manage bipolar disorder depends on its type, impact on daily life, and other factors, with various therapies available for support. The message encourages focusing on building positive paths that lead toward desired destinations.",

It is important to build a good relationship with your doctor, so you can decide what option is best for you. \n\nPain Medication \n\nFor some women with mild symptoms, no further treatment other than medication for pain may be needed. For women with minimal endometriosis who want to become pregnant, doctors are saying that, depending on the age of the woman and her amount of pain from the disease, the best thing to do is to have a trial period of unprotected sex for six months to one year. If she does not get pregnant in that time, then further treatment may be needed. \n\nHormone Treatment \n\nFor patients who do not wish to become pregnant, but need treatment for their disease, their doctors may suggest hormone treatment. Hormone treatment is most effective when growths are small. Hormones can come in pill form, by shot or injection, or in a nasal spray. There are several hormones used for this treatment including a combination of estrogen and progestin such as birth control pills, a progestin alone, Danocrine (a weak male hormone), and GnRH agonists (gonadotropin releasing hormone). \n\nBirth control pills control the growth of the tissue that lines the uterus and often decrease the amount of menstrual flow. They usually contain two hormones, estrogen and progestin. Once a woman stops taking them, the ability to become pregnant returns, but the symptoms of endometriosis also may return. Some women take birth control pills continuously, without using the sugar pills that signal the body to go through menstruation. When birth control pills are taken in this way, the menstrual period may stop altogether, which can reduce pain or get rid of it entirely. Some birth control pills contain only progestin, a progesterone-like hormone. Women who can't take estrogen use these pills to reduce menstrual flow. With these pills, some women may not have pain for several years after stopping treatment. All birth control pills might cause some mild side effects like weight gain, bleeding between periods, and bloating. \n\nDanocrine has become a more common treatment choice than either progestin or combination hormone pills. Side effects with Danocrine include oily skin, pimples or acne, weight gain, muscle cramps, tiredness, smaller breasts, breast tenderness, headaches, dizziness, weakness, hot flashes, or a deepening of the voice. Women on Danocrine probably will only get a period now and then, or might not get it at all. Women who take Danocrine also should take steps to prevent pregnancy because it can harm a baby growing in the uterus. Because other hormones, like birth control pills, should be avoided, health care providers recommend that you use condoms, a diaphragm, or other \"barrier\" methods to prevent pregnancy. \n\nGnRH agonists (used daily in a nose spray, or as an injection given once a month or every three months) prevent the body from making certain hormones to prevent menstruation. Without menstruation, the growth of endometriosis is slowed or stopped. These medications can cause side effects, such as hot flashes, tiredness, problems sleeping, headaches, depression, bone loss, and vaginal dryness. Most health care providers recommend that a woman stay on a GnRH agonist for about six months. After that time, the body will start having a period again and a woman could get pregnant. But, after that time, about half of women have some return of their endometriosis symptoms. \n\nSurgery \n\nSurgery is usually the best choice for women with extensive endometriosis, or those with severe pain. There are both minor and major surgeries that can help. Your doctor might suggest one of the following surgical treatments: \n\nLaparoscopy - also used to diagnose the disease, your doctor can treat you with this surgery as well. If your doctor is going to treat the endometriosis during this surgery, he or she must make at least tw Pregnancy. However, it's hard to get pregnant when you have endometriosis. Be careful with Lupron Depot it lowers your hormones which can cause bone problems.\n\nYou can also have surgery to remove them but they'll just come back. See a Reproductive Endocrinologist and try to get pregnant. If you wait too long for pregnancy it may not happen.\n\nStay hopeful and prayerful. According to the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada, \n\"[h]ysterectomy is often indicated in the presence of severe symptoms with failure of other treatments and when fertility is no longer desired.\"\n\nFor me, hysterectomy was a good option for controlling the pain of endometriosis, but it was only AFTER I had tried other treatments, such as Depo-Provera, Depo-Lupron, oral contraceptives (birth control pills, three laparoscopies with laser cautery to the endometriosis, pain medication, alternative treamtments including TENS, acupuncture, acupressure, chiropractic, and massage therapy.  \n\nThe BEST decision is the one that is best for the individual, and is decided between her and her doctor. First let me start off by saying that PREGNANCY DOES NOT CURE ENDO FOR ALL WOMEN, in fact for some women, their endo comes back after getting pregnant and others are not ready to get pregnant. I was diagnosed with endometriosis back when i was 13, and believe me, i wish there was a magical cure. I did a Distinguished Achievement Program project on endo in high school last year and researched various treatments. So far, the treatment that i have found works best for many women are using alternative treatments such as nutritional approaches. Many women have found relief by eating better such as ORGANIC FOODS, HERBAL REMEDIES, and lots of stress reducing exercise, such as yoga, meditation or even just running.

        "input": "summarize as INFORMATION: what are the duties of GYNAECOLOGIST? Some of the more common operations that gynaecologists perform include:\n\ntermination of pregnancy \ndilation and curettage (removal of the uterine contents, for various reasons, including miscarriage and menorrhagia; procedurally very similar to the above); \nhysterectomy (removal of the uterus); \noophorectomy (removal of the ovaries); \ntubal ligation; \nExploratory laporoscopy or laporotomy (used to diagnose and treat sources of pelvic and abdominal pain, dysmenorrhea, vaginal bleeding, etc.) \ncolposuspension ('tightening' of the ligaments around the vagina, a common therapy for incontinence and discomfort in older women); \nLarge Loop Excision of the Transition Zone (LLETZ), where the surface of the cervix, containing pre-cancerous cells identified on Pap smear are removed). Gynaecology is a typically a consultant specialty. In most countries, women must see a general practitioner first. If their condition requires knowledge or equipment unavailable to the GP, they are referred to a gynaecologist. However, in the United States, law and many health insurance plans allow gynaecologists to provide primary care, and some women select that option.\n\nAs in all of medicine, the main tools of diagnosis are clinical history and examination. Gynaecological examination is special in that it is quite intimate, and that it involves special equipment -- the speculum. The speculum consists of two hinged blades of flat metal, which are used to open the vagina, to permit examination of the cervix uteri. Gynaecologists may also do a bimanual examination (one hand on the abdomen, two fingers in the vagina), to palpate the uterus and ovaries. They may occasionally do a rectal exam. Male gynaecologists often have a female chaperone (nurse or medical student) for their examination. Virgins are not usually examined vaginally. An abdominal ultrasound is used normally to confirm the bimanual examination.\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigations\nSome of the investigations used in gynaecology are:\n\nabdominal ultrasound, to give a low-power view of the pelvic organs. \nvaginal ultrasound. A probe is passed into the vagina, which allows a detailed view of the uterus and its contents. \nblood tests. Levels of hormones such as estradiol, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone and progesterone are measured, as well as prolactin. \nhysteroscopy -- a fine tube is passed into the uterus via the cervix under a general anaesthetic. \nlaparoscopy -- tubes are passed into the peritoneal cavity, which is then insufflated with carbon dioxide. This is commonly used to diagnose endometriosis. \nMRI and CT scans are rarely used, apart from tumor staging in gynecological cancer. Pelvic X-ray is rare. It can be used to delineate the uterine cavity with an injected dye (hysterosalpingogram) and to measure the pelvic girdle.\n\n\nDiseases\nThe main conditions dealt with by a gynaecologist are:\n\ncancer of the cervix. The Papanicolaou (Pap) smear is a means of detecting this, by obtaining a sample of cervical epithelial cells and examining them under a microscope for malignant changes. All women are encouraged to have pap smears at regular intervals after commencing intercourse. \nincontinence of urine. \namenorrhoea (absent periods) \ndysmenorrhoea (painful periods) \ninfertility \nmenorrhagia (heavy periods). This is a main indication for hysterectomy. \nprolapse \nObviously there is some crossover in these areas. Amenorrhoea in a young girl may be referred to a paediatrician, incontinence to a urologist.

Often when this occurs, the doctor doing the delivery will arbitrarily assign gender - sometimes not even informing the parents.

HIV belongs to a subset of viruses called retroviruses or slow virus. \n\n\n \nThis is because it is a progressive disease. HIV is entered through the body through the mucous membranes or thru blood to blood contact. \n\n\nOnce you get the virus it slowly begins to attack the immune system, killing off healthy immune system cells. The deterioration and destruction of immune function leads to AIDS. \n\n\nAIDS is the final stage of the HIV infection. A person is said to have AIDS when the cd4 counts drops below 200 and or a person has 1 or more opportunistic infections. The OIs, as they are called, are normal infections that a healthy person would be able to fight off. \n\n\nThe four stages of the HIV infection are as follows: \n\n\n1) The period following infection is called the window. It is called this because it reflect the window of time between infection and that which antibodies are devlop in a person. The HIV test looks for antibodies not the virus. \n\n\n2) The second stage is called seroconversion. This is when the body begins to develop lots of antibodies to fight off the virus in the body. During this period a person may have flu like sympton. Also during this period is said to be very infectious. \n\n\n3) The third stage is called symptom free. During this period a person may have no sympton what so ever. This can last any where from 6 months to well over ten years. The medical world is not sure why some people are living sympton free for so long. \n\n\n4) The final stage is called AIDS. This is the period when TCELL drop to below 200 and the OI\"S are present. \n\n\nSo, as we see, HIV is a infection that will leads to AIDS. \n\n\nThe body immune system is slowly being attacked until it is destroyed and can't fight off infections. Once this happens a person is said to have AIDS. AIDS is the final stage.\"\n\nI hope the above answers your question.\n\n>>> Naveen Kumar AIDS (Acquired ImmunoDeficiency Syndrome) is a fatal disease caused by a rapidly mutating retrovirus (HIV) that attacks the immune system and leaves the victim vulnerable to infections, malignancies, and neurological disorders.\n\nHIV or Human Immunodeficiency Virus is a retrovirus that causes AIDS by affecting the very immune system cells (T4 lymphocytes) that would ordinarily fight off such a viral infection. HIV is not transmitted by casual contact; transmission requires a direct exchange of body fluids, such as blood or blood products, breast milk, semen, or vaginal secretions, most commonly as a result of sexual activity or the sharing of needles among drug users. Such a transmission may also occur from mother to baby during pregnancy or at birth. Saliva, tears, urine, feces, and sweat do not appear to transmit the virus. No. AIDS expands to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome is a state of advanced stage of HIV infection. HIV expands to Human Immunodeficiency Virus and is the virus that causes AIDS.\n\nThe term AIDS first appeared in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), USA in 1982 to describe \". . . a disease, at least moderately predictive of a defect in cell-mediated immunity, occurring with no known cause for diminished resistance to that disease\" The first cases of AIDS were identified in the United States in 1981, but it most likely existed here and in other parts of the world for many years before that. \n\nIn 1984 scientists proved that HIV causes AIDS.",

The four stages of HIV infection include the window period, seroconversion, a symptom-free stage that can last for varying durations, and the final AIDS stage. It's important to note that HIV is a virus, and AIDS is the advanced stage of the disease that occurs as the immune system is progressively compromised. The transmission of HIV requires direct exchange of certain body fluids, and it is not transmitted through casual contact.

QUOTE: \"Well, for starters, the gas that makes up a fart comes from two sources: more originates from the breakdown of food by the digestive system, and some is from swallowed air. In the first case, foodstuffs are broken down by enzymes, stomach acids, and intestinal bacteria in order for the energy in them to be made available to the body. Through the processes of digestion and fermentation, gases can be liberated from what's eaten. In the second case, air that a person swallows from eating, drinking, breathing, chewing gum, and being stressed, among other ways of entry, that's not expelled during a burp travels through the stomach and intestine, transforming into fart-ready mode. In either case, the gases flow down through the rest of the digestive tract and eventually exit the body - Poof! Ping! Pfft! Toot-toot! Kaboom! - expelled as a fart, or farts. And this silent or noisy expulsion of air can help bring about some relief and comfort from a buildup of gas within the lower part of the body.\" What exactly is a fart? The word \"fart\" can stand for: Frequency Actuated Rectal Tremor. Farting, also known as flatulence, is the act of passing intestinal gas from the butt. Intestinal gas comes from several sources: air we swallow, gas that seeps into our intestines from our blood, gas produced by chemical reactions in our guts, and gas produced by bacteria living in our guts. Burps are not farts that come out your mouth. They have to do with your stomach. The feces is decaying, and thus gives off gas, when enough gas is built up, it come out.",

The gas results from various sources, including the breakdown of food by digestive processes and the swallowing of air.

Additionally, swallowed air, accumulated through activities like eating, drinking, and stress, can transform into farts as it travels through the digestive tract.

By killing or damaging cells of the body's immune system, HIV progressively destroys the body's ability to fight infections and certain cancers.

Most notably, crucial immune cells called CD4+ T cells are disabled and killed during the typical course of infection. These cells, sometimes called \"T-helper cells,\" play a central role in the immune response, signaling other cells in the immune system to perform their special functions. \n\nA healthy, uninfected person usually has 800 to 1,200 CD4+ T cells per cubic millimeter (mm3) of blood. During HIV infection, the number of these cells in a person's blood progressively declines. When a person's CD4+ T cell count falls below 200/mm3, he or she becomes particularly vulnerable to the opportunistic infections and cancers that typify AIDS, the end stage of HIV disease. People with AIDS often suffer infections of the lungs, intestinal tract, brain, eyes and other organs, as well as debilitating weight loss, diarrhea, neurologic conditions and cancers such as Kaposi's sarcoma and certain types of lymphomas. \n\nMost scientists think that HIV causes AIDS by directly inducing the death of CD4+ T cells or interfering with their normal function, and by triggering other events that weaken a person's immune function. For example, the network of signaling molecules that normally regulates a person's immune response is disrupted during HIV disease, impairing a person's ability to fight other infections.

Tissue are packed into highly arranged bundles. When you work out you are actually contracting and relaxing the tissue that makes up the muscle. As you move your muscle some of the tissue break down causing the pain and friction. Resting a day between working out just gives time for the muscle to repair the broken down tissue. The benefit is that since some of the tissue had broken down when you work out the next day you rely on other tissue  that has not broken down in the muscle group to raise the weight that you are raising. The muscle will eventually get bulkier if you do it that way and it will be pretty painful because the tissue will eventually be broken down. Doctors don't usually recommend you to work out the same muscle group every day because they believe that the muscle should be fully repaired before you work out. In the Army, they would have us do an Easy Day, then a Hard Day.  Easy Day was basic warm-up followed by soccer or whatever.  Hard Day was warm-up followed by multiple mile run, workout in the gym, whatever.  They feel that it is required.\n\nAs for the muscle burn, that happens because you are burning the muscle and fat, to my understanding.  Depending on whether you are trying to build-up your muscles, gain tone, or lose weight, you will get different effects for different types of workouts. yes, you are suppose to work a different muscle group everyday. Because you don't want your muscles to get used to the same thing everyday then it becomes routine your body will be so used it that it will not burn fat and build muscle as much as it would if you change it up everyday. If you don't feel burn after your exercise you could be doing them wrong you should feel some burn. I workout twice a day everyday, and there are days when i will work out my arms in the morning and then come home and workout my arms again in the evening. they say you should work out your muscles as much as possible for they burn the most calories. Also, about the burn in your muscles, i don't  feel the burn all the time, but i can guarantee if you, if you are doing the exercise right, then you will see results within 6 weeks. It is always best to rotate the muscles you excersize.  Reason is that you do not want to end up 'muscle heavy', IE:If you only work one set of muscles, let's say in your arms, you will have tremendous arms, and not tremendous anything else.\nOnce the burn leaves, you are keeping them fit, but not adding to the bulk of the muscle.  hope this helps Ding!  What winnie said.  All you are doing working the same muscles every day is damaging them, you get a much better benefit if you rest them and allow the muscle to heal.\n\nAnd that \"if you do not feel the burn\" is the old philosophy of \"No paing, no gain\" which is basically now to be considered a load of horse crap.",
        "summary": "Working out the same muscle group every day can lead to muscle enlargement or bulkiness as tissues are densely packed in organized bundles. During exercise, the muscle tissues contract and relax, causing some breakdown and resulting in pain and friction. Resting a day between workouts allows for the repair of the broken-down tissues. This rest is essential as it forces reliance on unaffected tissues in the muscle group during subsequent workouts, contributing to muscle development. Doctors typically advise against daily workouts for the same muscle group, emphasizing the need for full muscle recovery before exercising again. In the military, the practice of alternating between Easy Days and Hard Days is common, allowing for adequate recovery. Muscle burn during exercise is believed to be a result of burning both muscle and fat, with different workout types producing varied effects on muscle building, toning, or weight loss. Rotating muscle groups in workouts is recommended to prevent the body from adapting to a routine, promoting effective fat burning and muscle development. Feeling a burn during exercise is considered normal, indicating that the workout is targeting the muscles correctly. It's advised to rotate exercises to avoid becoming 'muscle heavy' in one area and to allow muscles to heal and grow effectively. Simply working the same muscles every day can lead to damage without maximizing the benefits that come from rest and recovery.",

        "input": "summarize as EXPERIENCE: Is it true you should not work out the same muscle group every day? Working out the same muscle group every day just makes the muscle larger or blukier. Tissue are packed into highly arranged bundles. When you work out you are actually contracting and relaxing the tissue that makes up the muscle. As you move your muscle some of the tissue break down causing the pain and friction. Resting a day between working out just gives time for the muscle to repair the broken down tissue. The benefit is that since some of the tissue had broken down when you work out the next day you rely on other tissue  that has not broken down in the muscle group to raise the weight that you are raising. The muscle will eventually get bulkier if you do it that way and it will be pretty painful because the tissue will eventually be broken down. Doctors don't usually recommend you to work out the same muscle group every day because they believe that the muscle should be fully repaired before you work out. In the Army, they would have us do an Easy Day, then a Hard Day.  Easy Day was basic warm-up followed by soccer or whatever.  Hard Day was warm-up followed by multiple mile run, workout in the gym, whatever.  They feel that it is required.\n\nAs for the muscle burn, that happens because you are burning the muscle and fat, to my understanding.  Depending on whether you are trying to build-up your muscles, gain tone, or lose weight, you will get different effects for different types of workouts. yes, you are suppose to work a different muscle group everyday. Because you don't want your muscles to get used to the same thing everyday then it becomes routine your body will be so used it that it will not burn fat and build muscle as much as it would if you change it up everyday. If you don't feel burn after your exercise you could be doing them wrong you should feel some burn. I workout twice a day everyday, and there are days when i will work out my arms in the morning and then come home and workout my arms again in the evening. they say you should work out your muscles as much as possible for they burn the most calories. Also, about the burn in your muscles, i don't  feel the burn all the time, but i can guarantee if you, if you are doing the exercise right, then you will see results within 6 weeks. It is always best to rotate the muscles you excersize.  Reason is that you do not want to end up 'muscle heavy', IE:If you only work one set of muscles, let's say in your arms, you will have tremendous arms, and not tremendous anything else.\nOnce the burn leaves, you are keeping them fit, but not adding to the bulk of the muscle.  hope this helps Ding!  What winnie said.  All you are doing working the same muscles every day is damaging them, you get a much better benefit if you rest them and allow the muscle to heal.\n\nAnd that \"if you do not feel the burn\" is the old philosophy of \"No paing, no gain\" which is basically now to be considered a load of horse crap.",
        "summary": "In users expereince, one individual engages in twice-daily workouts, sometimes focusing on the same muscle group, such as arms, in both the morning and evening. The belief is that working out muscles as frequently as possible maximizes calorie burn. Despite this approach, the individual does not always feel the burn in their muscles. The idea behind the intense workout routine is to enhance calorie expenditure and potentially promote muscle development. However, it's important to note that rest and recovery periods are crucial for muscle repair, and overtraining without adequate recovery can lead to fatigue, injury, and diminished results. Listening to the body's signals, including the absence of the burn, is essential for a balanced and sustainable fitness routine. It may be beneficial for the individual to incorporate variety into their workouts, allowing different muscle groups to be targeted and ensuring proper recovery for optimal overall fitness.",

That's the best way to PREVENT the cold to begin with, making it the cheapest overall remedy.\n\nHere's something interesting: once you're showing the symptoms of a cold (sneezing, body aches, runny nose, etc.) you've already HAD the cold and your body is casting off the byproducts of the virus.\n\nAnd, because a cold is based in a virus, you don't really catch the same cold again. Your body adapts to that viral strain. If you catch another cold right after you just get over your last one, it's a new cold and you came down with it because your immune system was already depressed from the most recent one. Chicken soup and Advil cold&Sinus...works wonderful and just het some rest The least expensive is just plain rest and taking care of yourself.\n\nIf you've been taking a lot of cold meds, they can mess with your system and cause you to not sleep well.  If it's the stuffiness that keeps you from sleeping try a vaporizer to help clear your sinuses. (A crock pot set on low makes a good vaporizer.  Just be careful where you place it.)\n\nFor stuffiness and headaches, you can make a mixture of a couple tablespoons of olive oil and a few drops of lavender oil then massage around your eyes. (Don\u2019t get real close to your eye.)  Placing a warm moist cloth over your eyes after the massage will also help. Gargle with 3% H2O2 every hour until relieved. An excellent remedy is ginger tea.Add a small tsp each of ginger pwd, fennel seeds pwd,cinnamon pwd and a pinch of clove pwd to a cup of boiled water and let it sit covered for 10 mts.Strain and drink.You can have this tea a couple of times a day.\nFor more natural remedies check the link below\nhttp://indiacuisine.blogspot.com/2006/01/natural-home-remedies-to-fight-common.html",

That's the best way to PREVENT the cold to begin with, making it the cheapest overall remedy.\n\nHere's something interesting: once you're showing the symptoms of a cold (sneezing, body aches, runny nose, etc.) you've already HAD the cold and your body is casting off the byproducts of the virus.\n\nAnd, because a cold is based in a virus, you don't really catch the same cold again. Your body adapts to that viral strain. If you catch another cold right after you just get over your last one, it's a new cold and you came down with it because your immune system was already depressed from the most recent one. Chicken soup and Advil cold&Sinus...works wonderful and just het some rest The least expensive is just plain rest and taking care of yourself.\n\nIf you've been taking a lot of cold meds, they can mess with your system and cause you to not sleep well.  If it's the stuffiness that keeps you from sleeping try a vaporizer to help clear your sinuses. (A crock pot set on low makes a good vaporizer.  Just be careful where you place it.)\n\nFor stuffiness and headaches, you can make a mixture of a couple tablespoons of olive oil and a few drops of lavender oil then massage around your eyes. (Don\u2019t get real close to your eye.)  Placing a warm moist cloth over your eyes after the massage will also help. Gargle with 3% H2O2 every hour until relieved. An excellent remedy is ginger tea.Add a small tsp each of ginger pwd, fennel seeds pwd,cinnamon pwd and a pinch of clove pwd to a cup of boiled water and let it sit covered for 10 mts.Strain and drink.You can have this tea a couple of times a day.\nFor more natural remedies check the link below\nhttp://indiacuisine.blogspot.com/2006/01/natural-home-remedies-to-fight-common.html",

Consider using Advil Cold & Sinus for symptom relief and ensure ample rest. For congestion, use a crockpot as a vaporizer, taking caution with placement.

Your dentist would measure this with a probe.\n\nIf your pockets are deeper than 4 mm then it means that you have had bone loss  which is usually caused by periodontal disease (an infection in the gums). The best way to prevent periodontal problems is to brush and FLOSS your teeth regularly (brush at least twice a day for two minutes). \n\nI emphasize flossing, because often people don't realize just how important it is. The contact between the two teeth are where food are most likely to get stuck, and therefore where bacteria sticks most often, too. The purpose of flossing is to really clean that surface where two teeth touch. So instead of focusing on just making the floss go down between the teeth, you want to follow the sides of your teeth to make sure you remove the plaque. So you should be going up and down two to three times along the tooth on both sides of the contact.\n\nHope this helps!",

This complementary medicine has its foundation in ancient Tibetan Buddhism, apparently forgotten until its rediscovery in the late 19th century.  The aim of reiki is to promote health, maintain well-being, and help people attain a higher consciousness.  Practitioners draw on \"reiki energy\" channeling it to areas of need in themselves and their patients.  They borrow terminology from physics, claiming that reiki acts at an atomic level, causing the body's molecules to vibrate with higher intensity and thus dissolving energy blockages that lead to disharmony and disease.  \n\nA treatment session lasts about an hour; the practitioner directs reike energy through his hands to the patient.  The patient lies clothed on a treatment table and the practitioner holds his hands on or over the body in 12 basic positions for about five minutes each.  This is said to balance the body's energy centers or \"chakras.\"  Some patients may feel relaxed after treatment; others feel invigorated.\"\n\nTo get in touch with your own energy body as a beginner, I recommend T'ai Chi.

One way is by how quickly the disease develops and gets worse. The other way is by the type of blood cell that is affected.\n\nLeukemia is either acute or chronic. In acute leukemia, the abnormal blood cells are blasts that remain very immature and cannot carry out their normal functions. The number of blasts increases rapidly, and the disease becomes worse quickly. In chronic leukemia, some blast cells are present, but in general, these cells are more mature and can carry out some of their normal functions. Also, the number of blasts increases less rapidly than in acute leukemia. As a result, chronic leukemia worsens gradually.\n\nLeukemia can arise in either of the two main types of white blood cells: lymphoid cells or myeloid cells. When leukemia affects lymphoid cells, it is called lymphocytic leukemia. When myeloid cells are affected, the disease is called myeloid or myelogenous leukemia.\n\nThese are the most common types of leukemia:\n\n1.Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is the most common type of leukemia in young children. This disease also affects adults, especially those age 65 and older. \n2.Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) occurs in both adults and children. This type of leukemia is sometimes called acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). \n3.Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) most often affects adults over the age of 55. It sometimes occurs in younger adults, but it almost never affects children. \n4.Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) occurs mainly in adults. A very small number of children also develop this disease. \n5.Hairy cell leukemia is an uncommon type of chronic leukemia. This and other uncommon types of leukemia are not discussed here.

Leukemia can affect either lymphoid or myeloid cells, leading to lymphocytic or myelogenous leukemia, respectively. Common types include Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL), prevalent in young children; Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), affecting both adults and children; Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), primarily seen in adults over 55; Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), mostly occurring in adults; and Hairy Cell Leukemia, an uncommon form.

Whenever there is a situation that puts one \"under pressure\" whether it is giving a presentation at work or some guy is attacking you with a knife your body reacts to help defend yourself however necessary. When you get like this your heart races, you sweat to cool your body in case you have to work hard, your puples dialate so you can see everything, etc. Your body is protecting itself.\n Hope this helps. If you need claification let me know. its life\n\nsimple enough i think its cause your heart races. Straight from the source, word for word:\n\"Nervous or Scared?\nAs we mentioned, sweating responds to your emotional state. So when you are nervous, anxious or afraid, there is an increase in sympathetic nerve activity in your body as well as an increase in epinephrine secretion from your adrenal gland. These substances act on your sweat glands, particularly those on the palms of your hand and your armpits, to make sweat. Thus, you feel a \"cold\" sweat. Also, the increased sympathetic nerve activity in the skin changes it electrical resistance, which is the basis of the galvanic skin response used in lie detector tests.\n\"",
        "summary": "For information purposes, the sensation of sweating, especially in response to nervousness, anxiety, or fear, is a physiological response rooted in the human body's \"fight or flight\" mechanism. When faced with stressors or threats, the body activates various responses to prepare for action. This includes an increase in sympathetic nerve activity and the secretion of epinephrine from the adrenal gland. These substances affect sweat glands, particularly in the palms of the hands and armpits, leading to increased sweating. Additionally, the heightened sympathetic nerve activity alters the electrical resistance of the skin, contributing to the overall physiological response associated with the experience of sweating in stressful situations.",

I pray and talk to him. It seems to be the only way becuase other wise there isn't a whole lot of hope in life. You need to find something within yourself that makes you happy.  Don't search for other people or places to make you happy -- it has to come from within.  Once you find something within yourself that makes you happy, the friends and other things start to fall into place.  Search for your own hope in a higher power such as God. Find a hobby or interest that makes you feel good and do it -- this may take some trial and error, and that is okay!  Good luck and I will pray for you. I work at a counseling center, so obviously I feel counseling is a great tool, I don't know where you are located but if you live in an area that is currently short on sun light, their are alot of people whos depression is physical due to lack of light.

I mean Joe Public can only help so much. for me iam at my happiest when i play with video games. but mainly long walks-up to 6 miles 3-4 times a day. plus i get involve with yahoo answers and feel better too. yes i understand ur situation, i would suggest u to join Yoga classes, i bet it will help you. i personaly would suggest The Art of living organisation. check out the link u will findout more. Don't worry, be happey!! I also move to another county years ago and I know what you are talking about. just do not stay at home, go out.... force yourself to go out... go and do some volunteer job where you can find freinds or take classes... just get out Try reading this book: The only way that I have ever been able to get out of depression is when I focus on Jesus. I pray and talk to him. It seems to be the only way becuase other wise there isn't a whole lot of hope in life. You need to find something within yourself that makes you happy.  Don't search for other people or places to make you happy -- it has to come from within.  Once you find something within yourself that makes you happy, the friends and other things start to fall into place.  Search for your own hope in a higher power such as God. Find a hobby or interest that makes you feel good and do it -- this may take some trial and error, and that is okay!  Good luck and I will pray for you. I work at a counseling center, so obviously I feel counseling is a great tool, I don't know where you are located but if you live in an area that is currently short on sun light, their are alot of people whos depression is physical due to lack of light. Sleep is also a huge impact on mood, if you are not rested you will not feel one hundred percent. If this continues to be an issue, I would encourage you to seek counseling to try to find the deap root of the problem.",
        "summary": "To navigate depression, individuals employ diverse strategies. For one person, joy is found in activities like playing video games, taking long walks, and participating in online communities. Another suggests overcoming the challenges of moving to a new county by actively engaging in social activities, volunteering, or taking classes. A different approach involves finding solace in faith, with a focus on prayer and connection to Jesus as a source of hope. From a counseling perspective, seeking professional help is emphasized, especially for those affected by the physical aspects of depression in areas with limited sunlight. Overall, a multifaceted approach, combining personal interests, social interaction, spiritual connection, and professional support, is recommended for managing depression.",

Gee, can I ask what exactly you are depressed about?\n\nSo, my point is that you can only be helped if you're willing to let others help you. This of course means taking advice from someone in a professional enough position to comment on your condition (e.g. how bad it is). Sure, you may need medication or you may not. Why do you refuse to take drugs anyway? You know eventually you may not even have a choice in taking some.

My uncle had to stop soda altogether because of this (good luck!):\n\nAn ulcer is an open wound that develops in the tissue of a digestive tract. \n\nThere are two main types of ulcers- \n\nPeptic or gastric ulcers, they form in the stomach. The gastric juice that is produced in the stomach contains hydrochloric acid, mucus, and an enzyme called pepsin. Sometimes, the mixture of pepsin and acids acts on the wall of the digestive tract and the result is a peptic ulcer. \n\nDuodenal ulcer forms in the small intestines near the stomach. They are more common than gastric ulcers. \n\nHow do you know if you have an ulcer? Pain! The pain may occur from 30 to 60 minutes after eating. The pain rarely comes in the morning, but usually follows after lunch and dinner. And it may occur after midnight. \n\nIntense burning pain occurs in the area of the lower chest and/or upper abdomen. Additional symptoms that may be experienced are weight loss, a decrease in appetite, anemia, nausea, and vomiting. \n\nThere may be times when the pain of an ulcer seems to be gone and then it suddenly returns. Pain associated with ulcers affect different people in different ways. \n\nThere are different causes for the formation of ulcers. In some cases the bacterium \"H. pylori\" is responsible for the majority of ulcers. It says that too much stomach acid aggravates the already existing problem. People who develop ulcers usually have a higher concentration of hydrochloric acid than is normal. \n\nSome medications are known to cause ulcers such as those used to relieve the swelling of arthritis. Aditionally care should be taken when using ibuprofen and aspirin since they can cause irritation and bleeding. \n\nTense, ambitious, hard-driving people are more likely to develop ulcers than calm people. Other causes are alcoholic beverages, caffeine, stress, and smoking. Drinks that often contain caffeine are soda, tea, and coffee. Chocolate also contains caffeine and should be avoided. \"The American Medical Association Family Medical Guide\" adds that the elderly are more susceptible to developing a stomach ulcer. People who do not eat regular meals or who are rushed during mealtime are also likely candidates for this type of ulcer. \n\nAlthough uncers can bleed, bleeding due to a stomach ulcer is rare, but it can be very serious. An ulcer that bleeds slowly over a period of time, may eventually lead to anemia, weight loss, decrease in appetite, and infection. A more serious complication of a persistent gastric ulcer is stomach cancer. \n\n\n\nWhen a duodenal ulcer goes untreated, the risks are low. However, bleeding from duodenal ulcers can cause anemia. Heavy bleeding from this type of ulcer may cause nausea, vomiting, and dark stools. Scarring from a duodenal ulcer can also cause a dangerous blockage. \n\nIf you find the above mentioned symptoms, contact the doctor. Immediate medical attention should be given if the patient is vomiting blood, has cold skin accompanied by sweating, faintness, weakness, or is experiencing extreme pain. Early diagnosis and treatment is essential for prompt healing and also to prevent the ulcer from coming back. \n\nThe above is provided for your information, but you are responsible for your own actions to deal with your ulcers or gastro esophageal health problems.

All the hormones and stuff they put in our food and milk, doesn't help with these issues. Good Luck kids vary in size....what one person thinks is too big, another might think is too small...my daughter is 6 years old and weighs 34 lbs....I was worried she wasn't eating enough or something, the doctor said it's a normal weight. if you think your son is too big, try to do something about it. if you don't, don't worry. My cousins son was a big baby, if I recall he may have been around the same weight as your son at the same age. now he's six and weighs about 50 lbs. so it'll all even out. don't worry. Is your son's dad tall? If so then no cause my daughter is in a 5T shirt and 5 slim jeans and she is only 3 yrs. old. She was in the same size clothes your son is in right now at that age. So your son is ok and healthy. sounds like a healthy baby to me",
        "summary": "The experiences shared highlight the variability in children's growth, influenced by family history and external factors like hormones in food and milk. One person mentions their sister's children growing differently in size, attributing it to these factors. Another expresses concern about their daughter's weight but is reassured by the doctor that it's normal. Someone else shares a similar experience with their cousin's son, emphasizing that growth can even out over time and urging not to worry. The final experience compares the size of a three-year-old to the person's own daughter at that age, indicating that the child is healthy and on track for growth. Overall, the message is that children's growth can vary, and individual cases should be considered within the context of family history and health assessments.",

For example, in the US in the early 20th century there were very large differences in life expectancy between people of different races, which have since lessened. There remain significant differences in life expectancy between men and women in the US and other developed countries, with women outliving men. These differences by sex have been reducing in recent years, with men's life expectancy improving at a faster rate than women's. Poverty and inequality has a very substantial effect on life expectancy. In the United Kingdom life expectancy in the wealthiest areas is ten years longer than the poorest areas and the gap appears to be increasing as life expectancy for the prosperous continues to increase while in more deprived communities there is little increase. (Department of Health -[Tackling health inequalities]: Status report on the Programme for Action\n\nAir pollution may also reduce life expectancy, especially for those living near busy roads, due to the exhaust fumes from cars. Occupation may also have a major effect on life expectancy. Well-educated professionals working in offices have a high life expectancy, while asbestos and coal miners do not.

Medieval England had an average lifespan of 33 years, and by the 1800s, it reached 37 years. In the early 20th century, it rose to 50 years, and around 1940, it was approximately 65 years. Currently, in the Western world, the average lifespan is around 77-81 years. Life expectancy worldwide varies due to differences in public health, medicine, and nutrition among countries. Intra-country variations exist, such as racial differences in the early 20th century United States, which have since reduced. Disparities persist between genders, with women generally outliving men, though this gap is narrowing. Socioeconomic factors, air pollution, occupation, genetic disorders, and drug use also influence life expectancy, emphasizing the impact of broader social, environmental, and individual factors on human longevity. In the United Kingdom, there is a notable gap in life expectancy between the wealthiest and poorest areas, influenced by factors like poverty and inequality. Air pollution, occupation, genetic disorders, and drug use also contribute to variations in individual life expectancy.",

        "input": "summarize as INFORMATION: what is the oxyhemoglobin disassociation curve? The oxygen dissociation curve is a graph that shows the percent saturation of hemoglobin at various partial pressures of oxygen.  Commonly a curve may be expressed with the P50  value.  This is a value which tells the pressure at which the erythrocytes are fifty percent saturated with oxygen.  (Bouverot, 1985).  The purpose of an oxygen dissociation curve is to show the equilibrium of oxyhemoglobin and nonbonded hemoglobin at various partial pressures (Oxygen Dissociation Curve).  At high partial pressures of oxygen, usually in the lungs, hemoglobin binds to oxygen to form oxyhemoglobin.  When the blood is fully saturated all the erythrocytes are in the form of oxyhemoglobin.  As the erythrocytes travel to tissues deprived of oxygen the partial pressure of oxygen will decrease.  Consequently, the oxyhemoglobin releases the oxygen to form hemoglobin (Schmidt-Nielsen, 1997).  \n\nThe sigmoid shape of the oxygen dissociation curve is a result of the cooperative binding of oxygen to the four polypeptide chains.  Cooperative binding is the characteristic of a hemoglobin to have a greater ability to bind oxygen after a subunit has bound oxygen (Oxygen Dissociation Curve).  Thus, hemoglobin is most attracted to oxygen when three of the four polypeptide chains are bound to oxygen.  \n\n \n\nFactors that Influence Oxygen Binding\n\n    *\n\n      Temperature- Increasing the temperature denatures the bond between oxygen and hemoglobin, which increases the amount of oxygen and hemoglobin and decreases the concentration of oxyhemoglobin (Schmidt-Nielsen, 1997).  The dissociation curve shifts to the right.\n    *\n\n      pH- A decrease in pH (increase in acidity) by addition of carbon dioxide or other acids causes a Bohr Shift.  A Bohr. shift is characterized by causing more oxygen to be given up as oxygen pressure increases and it is more pronounced in animals of smaller size due to the increase in sensitivity to acid (Schmidt-Nielsen, 1997).  The dissociation curve shifts to the right.\n    *\n\n      Organic Phospates- 2,3-Diphosphoglycerated (DPG) is the primary organic phosphate in mammals.  DPG binds to hemoglobin which rearranges the hemoglobin into the T-state, thus decreasing the affinity of oxygen for hemoglobin (T and R State).  The curve shifts to the right. The oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve is an important tool for understanding how our blood carries and releases oxygen. Specifically, the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve relates oxygen saturation (SO2) and partial pressure of oxygen in the blood (PO2), and is determined by what is called \"hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen,\" that is, how readily hemoglobin acquires and releases oxygen molecules from its surrounding tissue. The oxygen dissociation curve is a graph that shows the percent saturation of hemoglobin at various partial pressures of oxygen. Commonly a curve may be expressed with the P50 value. This is a value which tells the pressure at which the erythrocytes are fifty percent saturated with oxygen. to the thing, to the machine turned rotary shift, and wrenched the flabulator, dah-h-f-h-h-,  i'm retarded.",
        "summary": "For information purposes, the oxygen dissociation curve illustrates how hemoglobin in our blood binds and releases oxygen in response to varying oxygen levels. A key indicator, the P50 value, signifies the pressure at which half the red blood cells are saturated with oxygen. In the lungs, where oxygen levels are high, hemoglobin forms oxyhemoglobin. During circulation to oxygen-deprived tissues, the curve shows how oxyhemoglobin releases oxygen. The curve's sigmoid shape results from cooperative binding, enhancing oxygen affinity. Factors influencing binding include temperature, pH (Bohr Shift), and organic phosphates like 2,3-DPG, which decrease oxygen affinity, causing the curve to shift to the right. Understanding this curve is crucial for comprehending how our blood effectively carries and releases oxygen.",

It could be an infection or the onset of an even more serious illness!\n\nWhen I was experiencing vertigo, it was unbearable.  I had to move very slowly just to be able to get through a few minutes without feeling the room spinning.... My diagnosis?  A simple ear infection. I was given antibiotics (pills) and after the meds were gone, so was the ear infection and the spinning room. My dad drinks Stugeron You really need to go see a doctor.  My Grandmother has suffered from Vertigo for years and she lives a perfectly normal life. I had vertigo awhile ago for a couple of days, and then on and off for a couple of weeks. The doctor put me on two meds. One was a strong antihistimine and the other was something to help stop the dizziness/nausa associated with vertigo. Vertigo can be caused by allergy problems, as well as other things. Basically it messes up your equalibrium etc. Try looking on line at a reputable medical site about it. try this site: http://curezone.com/dis/1.asp?C0=359\nhope it helps. agree doctor is best place to start. Treatment depends on the cause so it would be best to see a doctor to find out what the exact cause is, so the proper treatment can be started. You have several options to treat your Vertigo. Because Vertigo is not a disease, Vertigo treatment and Vertigo remedies depend upon diagnosing the underlying cause. Once the cause is identified, doctors may choose from among these Vertigo treatment options:\n\nVestibular Rehabilitation Therapy\n    Vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) is a physical therapy-based Vertigo treatment. It is designed to reduce the effects of Vertigo symptoms by introducing the patient to a series of exercises for Vertigo. Successful Vertigo treatment using this method is said to improve balance and prevent falls by helping to restore functionality to the vestibular system.\n\n    VRT is not always successful. Major considerations that must be addressed when deciding upon this particular Vertigo treatment include:\n\nThe patient's age \nThe ability of the patient to remember and follow directions. \nThe general physical and mental health of the patient \nThe patient's physical strength \nVertigo Medication\n    If the underlying causes of Vertigo are diagnosed to be an ear infections that is caused by the presence of bacteria, the the doctor may prescribe antibiotics such as amoxicillin or ceftriaxone. \n\n    The problem with taking these types of antibiotics, other than the expense of the prescription, is that they have produced side effects in many people including allergic reaction like shortness of breath; throat closure; hives; facial, lips and tongue swelling, seizures, severe watery diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Some patients have even reported unusual bleeding.\n\n    A type of Vertigo known as Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, which is believed to be caused by a calcium buildup in the semicircular canals of the inner ear, is frequently treated with a drug called meclizine or Antivert. Side effects of this Vertigo medication may include drowsiness, dry mouth, and blurred vision.\n\n    When meclizine does not work, the doctor will try certain benzodiazepines such as clonazepam, or antihistamines such as promethazine. Side effects of these drugs include drowsiness, lack of coordination, confusion, fatigue, insomnia, and tremors.\n\nVertigo Surgery\n    If the Vertigo symptoms are caused by an ear infection, and those infections become chronic, the doctor may opt to perform a surgical procedure whereby an incision is made in the eardrum and a small tube is placed in the incision which prevents fluid and bacteria from building up inside of the ear.\n\n    I know you're wondering is their a better way, a safer, faster or more efficient way you can permanently deal with your Vertigo. \n \n Finally, You Have A Real Answer, Equitab?\n \nHow Equitab\u2122 is Different for You\n    You only need five minutes and one simple solution for your Vertigo. Equitab\u2122 is the only 100% natural product that works to reduce the symptoms of Vertigo as well as decrease the chances of them reoccurring.\n\nIt's amazing how this simple solution was overlooked for so long before it was brought to you. \n\nHow Equitab\u2122 Was Discovered \n     You'll be shocked when you learn how and why Equitab\u2122 was first made and used. Originally it was used by a small group of test subjects who suffered the symptoms of Vertigo including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, lightheadedness, faintness, and unsteadiness.\n\n     Once the Scientists at Selmedica Healthcare, the people who make Equitab\u2122, saw how fast these people received relief from their misery, the product was made available to the public. Since then thousands and thousands of Vertigo sufferers have turned to Equitab\u2122 for Vertigo relief. Because it worked for them you know it will work for you --guaranteed!\n\nWhat Equitab\u2122 Does For You\n     You have to understand that Equitab\u2122 is 100% natural and 100% unique. It is made from a precisely balanced blend of Ginkgo extracts, dried rhizome of ginger, kelp, and cayenne. \n\n     This unique, all-natural Vertigo fighting formula works together ",
        "summary": "In regards to vertigo it is crucial to see a doctor as soon as possible for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Treatment options may include Vestibular Rehabilitation Therapy for symptom reduction and, in some cases, vertigo surgery. If vertigo symptoms stem from chronic ear infections, addressing the infections is essential for effective management. Seeking professional medical advice is emphasized to ensure the most suitable course of action based on the specific cause of vertigo.",

Try holding an ice cube to your throat for about 20 to 30 seconds. Also try holding your nose while you take big gulps of water. What I have done for hiccups all my life is swallow saliva immediately after receiving the first hiccup and it goes away. I've done it forever and it works, try it next you get it. And don't over eat it sometimes causes hiccups. Hold your breath. Take a deep breath. Hold your breath under water for 10 minutes. Get a friend to help. Set a glass of water on a table with a straw in it and plug your ears and nose while drinking from the straw, I swear it works. The spoon full of sugar works too, but it's hard to swallow, you'll have to drink water anyway. Holding your breath doesn't really work. Burping does. There are two steps for a hiccup.. let's say you go hic (when you inhale) and then cup (when you exhale) Instead of exhaling the cup, burp it out. Hic, hold the air bubble in your throat and try to make it travel up, and burp it out. If you don't know how to make yourself burp (like myself), get yourself some coke or 7up or sprite, anything gassy to make you burp faster :o) eat one teaspoon of sugar, will provide instant relief! Eat a spoonful of sugar quickly. Your senses will overload with the response from the receptors that the sugar triggered off, and you won't hiccup anymore. focus on your middle name for 5-10 seconds then say it OUT LOUD. if that doesn't work, use brother/sisters middle name. 2 methods, both work, but one is a bit difficult\n1. Bite down on the middle part of a straw or pen or pencil in your mouth (the straw is not in your mouth like you are using to drink with, you are biting on the middle so the ends are outside your mouth near your cheeks).  Then drink a half of a glass of water.\n\n2.  Take a full glass of water and drink on the opposite side that you normally do (so your chin is pratically in the glass).  In order to do this you will have to bend your neck and head.  Drink about half the glass.\n\nGood luck",

Histamine is a chemical that is responsible for many of the signs and symptoms of allergic reactions, for example, swelling of the lining of the nose, sneezing, and itchy eyes.

Fexofenadine blocks one type of receptor for histamine (the H1 receptor) and thus prevents activation of H1 receptor-containing cells by histamine.

This clogs up you're pores and produces smells like the food you've consumed. Funky meat (like hotdogs and hamburgars) produces B.O. \n\nThen I went to Greece straight from Germany.  In athens, they mainly eat lots of greens (some call these vegtables),seafood, and Vino (wine).  The Greeks smelt really good. . . Yummy, I'd take a yummy smelling Greek God any day!\n\nTo get more greens, you can eat vegtables, go to Jamba Juice and take shots of Wheatgrass, or buy chloriphorm in a pill. . . I really suggest just eating more vegtables. You need to use deodorant every day. It could be from your diet.  Also try to get more water, plain water not soda or tea or flavored water in your diet and see what that does. Your body uses skin to release toxins stuck in the body. The toxins smell. \n\nEvaluate what you are eating. Processed foods have lots of chemicals that smell bad when digested.\n\nStudy some inner body cleansing. Simple start: get a colonic, find Christian herbalist to help cleanse your body. Focus on parasites first. Some estimates state that 85% of North Americans have some parasite. They produce ammonia and other waste products that clog up the body and create bad smells (toxins trying to leave the body through your skin) Then work on cleansing other organs, liver, kidneys etc.",
        "summary": "For information purposes, diet plays a crucial role in body odor, as highlighted in the passage. The author contrasts the unpleasant smell associated with a meat-heavy diet in Germany, particularly funky meats like hotdogs and hamburgers, with the fresher-smelling Greeks in Athens who consume more greens, seafood, and wine. The text emphasizes the body's use of skin to release toxins, with a recommendation to evaluate and improve dietary choices. It suggests avoiding processed foods due to their chemical content and advocates for inner body cleansing, starting with colonics and seeking herbalist assistance. Parasites are highlighted as potential contributors to bad smells, with estimates suggesting a high prevalence in North Americans. The passage concludes by advising on the cleansing of other organs, such as the liver and kidneys, for overall well-being.",

        "input": "summarize as INFORMATION: why do your fingers get wrinkled when you get out of the water? The skin of your fingers absorb water/ fluid and swell also. The skin of your finger consists of tiny little skin cells, 100's and 100's of millions of them.  Each cell is so small you would need a powerful microscope for looking at 100 of them.\n\nAll cells are surrounded by a membrane.  Somewhat like a very, very tiny balloon filled with salty jello.  The insides of the outermost cells are salty and dehydrated because your skin grows from underneath, the dermis, close to the capillaries (blood supply).\n\nThe outer skin, called the epidermis, consists of cells which are wearing out and drying up, although they are mostly not quite dead yet.  The very oldest ones that are dead come off when you scrub or shower. Some are falling off all the time, but they are so small you do not see them.\n\nSince the epidermis consists of rather dry cells, it is able to absorb water.  The cell walls allow the water in your tub, shower, or pool to penetrate into each cell.  The insides, being salty, are have a strong affinity for water.  \n\nIf you spend a long time in the water, the epidermal cells swell up, increasing in size, somewhat like the the balloons mentioned earlier being filled with more water.\n\nWhen the skin on the outside of your hands or toes swells it has more surface area than previously.  Instead of being like a tight fitting glove, it becomes more like a glove that is too big.\n\nIf you put on a glove that is too big, it will have wrinkles instead of being stretched smoothly.\n\nThe entry of water into a cell is called osmosis.  If you stay in fresh water for an extremely long time, many cells will absorb so much water they will burst.  That is called lysis.\n\nRed blood cells are much more fragile than skin cells.  When combined with fresh water they rapidly absorb so much water that they all appear to dissolve.  Each one of the millions and millions of red blood cells has burst.  That is called hemolysis.\n\nRopes made from plant fibers are also composed of cells.  Test a rope:  See if it shrinks in length when absorbing water or drying out.\n\nWhen the skin on your fingers and toes dries out, the cells shrink in size, and the skin becomes more smooth and taut, like a tight, well fitted glove.\n\nYour skin is very important.  Without it you would be just like a raw piece of meat, ready for the flies and germs to eat.\n\nTake good care of your skin.  Do not get sunburned.  When you have a bad cut that is healing, you should try to keep your hands out of dirty water or ponds.\nThese contain potentially dangerous bacteria that could infect your open or healing wound.\n\nTaking a shower or washing your hands in clean water is okay.  Just be sure to put antibiotic ointment and a fresh bandage over the cut when you are done.\n\nYour teacher might be able to show you some pictures of bacteria (germs) or let you look at live ones through a microscope.  \n\nOnly one person is allowed to look through at a time.  Everyone else must stand back and not push the observer or touch their head.  Otherwise you could injure one of their eyes or both by knocking them into the eyepiece or binoculars of the microscope.\n\nSome people have gone blind that way.  No horsing around !!  Strictly enforced.\n\nDuring winter, good skin care means putting lotion on your hands and wearing gloves while outside in the cold winter air.\n\nPeople who drink a carrot milkshake daily, made in a blender, have very beautiful skin once they have done this for six months.\n\nHealthy skin makes both boys and girls look better. This site explain it perfectly:\nhttp://kidshealth.org/kid/talk/qa/wrinkly_fingers.html",
        "summary": "For information purposes, the skin on your fingers is composed of numerous tiny cells, each surrounded by a membrane resembling a miniature balloon filled with salty gelatin. The outermost layer, the epidermis, consists of cells that are drying out and wearing out, continually replenished by the growth from underneath, the dermis. The epidermis can absorb water, allowing it to penetrate the cells and cause them to swell, akin to balloons filling with water. When skin swells, it increases in surface area, resembling a loose-fitting glove with wrinkles instead of a smooth, taut surface. Osmosis, the entry of water into cells, occurs during this process. Prolonged exposure to water can lead to cell bursting, known as lysis. Conversely, when the skin dries out, cells shrink, resulting in a smoother and taut appearance. Proper skin care is emphasized, including avoiding sunburn, keeping wounds clean, and moisturizing during winter. The importance of skin is highlighted as a protective barrier against external elements. Overall, good skin care contributes to a healthier and more appealing appearance for both boys and girls.",

I sincerely hope this helps! you should get away from everything that makes you panic, or just call a doctor they could help you I would recommend Louise Hay's \"Self-Esteem Affirmations\" on CD. You can listen to it over and over again and the positive messages get into your subconscious. I also recommend \"Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway\" by Susan Jeffers. It teaches you to repeat \"I'll Handle It\", which is very helpful during a panic attack.\n\nI have suffered from panic attacks for over 3 years and the above suggestions are the only thing that have helped me. meditate Panic attacks are extremely frightening and often very disabling. Suggested methods for overcoming them depend on vairous factors including - how frequent the attacks are, what disruption they cause in your life and whether they are associated with any particular situation. If your panic attacks are repititive and frequent you may have consulted a mental health professional. Psychological therapies and medication are the two main methods used. Psychological therapies like relaxation training and Exposure and response prevention aim at recognition and working through a panic attack, so that they eventually decrease in frequency. Medication is used if psychological therapies do not work, if the attacks are very  severe or in conjunction with psychological treatment. Common ones have included antidepressants such as Fluoxetine, venlafaxine etc. I would steer clear of benzos as they may be habit forming and one quickly gets habituated to their actions.\n\nIn the end the best person to contact may be your psychiatrist or psychologist. I have no knowledge of any other methods though they exist and information is available on the web. I have had panic attacks also. I would highly recommend trying several natural strategies before doing any prescription medication. There is a great book called \"Natural Relief for Anxiety: Complementary Strategies for Easing Fear, Panic & Worry\" that outlines various strategies.\n\nFirst, one of the most immediate things you can do is to cut out caffeine, alcohol, cigarettes and any drugs. These things obviously disrupt any physical and mental balances.\n\nSecond, exercise exercise exercise. There is a lot of scientific data that says *vigorous* exercise can really be the most effective way to clean up your head and also strengthen your heart. Regular exercise (I recommend swimming as the most effective) will definitely strengthen your heart, put your blood pressure at normal levels and reduce any sensations of heart palpitations that are associated with panic attacks.\n\nThird, take at least 2 hours per day to relax/meditate. I would recommend a combination of yoga, a soak in a hot bath or hot tub and a nap in quiet room with nothing but candles, very soft relaxing music. Turn off the phone, turn off the lights, lock the doors, just relax, breath, meditate. If you can afford massage, I think that is a way to complement this relaxation time.\n\nFourth, when you actually have a panic attack, try this very simple strategy. First say to yourself over and over \"Everything is fine, it's just a panic attack. People have them everyday. It's uncomfortable but it will pass very soon.\" As you repeat this to yourself, breathe in very deeply and very slowly ... breath in for 4-5 seconds, hold for 4-5 seconds and release for 4-5 seconds. Do this sequence 20 times in a row. It will quickly reduce your heart rate and increase oxygen flow to your brain which in turns increases your rationality, thereby reducing your irrationality (the panic).\n\nFifth, read the book I recommend. There are some special diet stratgies, possible food allergies that could be involved and vitamin/mineral supplements that can help you.\n\nSixth, find a therapist that specializes in anxiety/panic disorders. You will need to find out what is the root cause of your panic ... that is, what exactly are you so afraid of? \n\nPeople do conquer panic attacks. You can do it!!",

Some individuals can engage in the activity shortly after, while others, like the person asking, may need to wait for hours. The differences in male and female anatomy mean that achieving multiple orgasms, as women can, is not a standard capability for men. The natural design of the male body typically accommodates one act at a time, and experiencing multiple acts consecutively or shortly after varies among individuals.",

These substances consist of radionuclides, or pharmaceuticals that have been labelled with radionuclides (radiopharmaceuticals). In diagnosis, radioactive substances are administered to patients and the radiation emitted is measured. The majority of these diagnostic tests involve the formation of an image using a gamma camera. Imaging may also be referred to as radionuclide imaging or nuclear scintigraphy. Other diagnostic tests use probes to acquire measurements from parts of the body, or counters for the measurement of samples taken from the patient. In therapy, radionuclides are administered to treat disease or provide palliative pain relief. For example, administration of iodine-131 is often used for the treatment of thyrotoxicosis and thyroid cancer.\n\nNuclear medicine imaging tests differ from most other imaging modalities in that the tests primarily show the physiological function of the system being investigated as opposed to the anatomy. In some centres, the nuclear medicine images can be superimposed on images from modalities such as CT or MRI to highlight which part of the body the radiopharmaceutical is concentrated in. This practice is often referred to as image fusion.\n\nNuclear medicine diagnostic tests are usually provided by a dedicated department within a hospital and may include facilities for the preparation of radiopharmaceuticals. The specific name of a department can vary from hospital to hospital, with the most common names being the nuclear medicine department and the radioisotope department.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_medicine it consist of Radiation therapy to Nuclear body imaging studies.\n\nthey use molecular level of study to find out the disease or treatment modalitis.

To diagnose eczema, dermatologists examine the skin and ask about: \n\nWhen the skin condition first appeared \n\nSigns and symptoms, such as long-term pruritus (itching) or recurring dermatitis (inflammation of the skin) \n\nCertain circumstances that may aggravate the condition, such as excessively dry air or emotional stress \n\nFamily medical history, including questions about close blood relatives who have asthma, hay fever, or eczema \n\nPersonal medical history \n\nIn some cases, a skin biopsy may be performed to rule out other causes. \n\nAllergies are more common in individuals with atopic dermatitis, and allergy testing may be considered when a patient has:\n\nSignificant indications of allergies, such as gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea and colic in infants) or hives \n\nBeen poorly responsive or unresponsive to treatment \n\nIf a food allergy is suspected, testing for allergic reactions to eggs, milk, peanuts, soy, wheat, fish, and tree nuts (e.g., walnuts, cashews) are usually performed as these foods are responsible for 85% of all food allergies. A positive allergy test does not confirm the food allergy. A suspected food allergy must be subjected to a \"challenge.\" A challenge is conducted by having the patient eat the suspected food and observing the patient for a reaction. Even a challenge does not guarantee that the food is the trigger because: 1) another trigger may be present and causing the reaction or 2) the patient\u2019s reaction may be delayed. Consequently, allergy testing has limited value. However, it is useful for eliminating foods that cause immediate and severe reactions or welts.\n\nDermatologists may use a \u201cpatch test\u201d to determine if the patient has allergic contact dermatitis, a type of eczema that develops when the person has an allergic reaction to a substance that contacts the skin. The reaction generally occurs a few hours after the substance contacts the skin and settles down within a few days if the substance does not contact the skin again. A patch test exposes the patient\u2019s skin to minute amounts of substances that may have caused the reaction. When the test is positive, the dermatologist must determine if the chemical caused the dermatitis and if so, if it is the primary cause or an aggravating factor. Further testing may be necessary.\n\nTreatment\nOnce eczema is diagnosed, a treatment plan will be made based on:\n\nType and severity of the eczema present \n\nAge, health, and medical history (including presence of other conditions) \n\nHistory of previous treatment \n\nThe primary goal of treatment is to relieve discomfort by controlling the signs and symptoms. Since eczema is usually dry and itchy, most treatment plans involve applying lotions, creams, or ointments to keep the skin as moist as possible. The treatment plan also may require lifestyle modifications and using medication as directed. \n\nA topical (applied to the skin) medication may be prescribed to help relieve itching and inflammation. Another way to treat the itch is with a non-sedating antihistamine. If itching is severe, a sedative antihistamine may be recommended.

One is the evolutionary drive to pass on her genes, the other is the need to stay healthy enough to rear as many children as possible. \"Menopause draws the line between the two,\" Perls says.

For instance, studies have indicated that estrogen can have a protective effect against Alzheimer's Disease.

Harvard researchers studying centenarians propose that menopause is a significant determinant of lifespan for both women and men. According to Thomas Perls, a geriatrician at Harvard Medical School, women's longevity is influenced by a delicate balance between the evolutionary drive to pass on genes and the need to remain healthy enough to raise multiple generations. Menopause serves as a crucial factor, safeguarding older women from the risks associated with late-life childbirth and allowing them to live long enough to care for their children and grandchildren.",

You should try flossing, brushing after every meal and remember to brush your gums for a healthier flow so you can`t get any cavities or gum rott. Don`t worry if your teeth bleed when you floss you probably just haven`t flossed enough, and remember to brush for atleast 2-3 minutes.

Manifested by symptoms that interfere with the ability to work, study, sleep eat and enjoy once-pleasurable activities.\nDysthymia. Involves long-term, chronic symptoms that aren\u2019t as disabling as those of major depression but that interfere with functioning well or feeling good.\nBipolar disorder, or manic-depressive illness. Characterized by cycling moods, with severe highs (mania) and lows (depression). In the \nmanic cycle, people may be extremely active, talkative and energetic.\n\nSYMPTONS\nPersistent sad, anxious or \u201cempty\u201d mood\nFeeling pessimistic, hopeless\nFeeling guilty, worthless, helpless\nLoss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities that were once enjoyed\nFatigue, loss of energy\nDifficulty concentrating, remembering, making decisions\nSleeping too much or too little, middle-of-the-night or early-morning waking.\nReduced appetite and weight loss, or increased appetite and weight gain.\nThoughts of death or suicide\nRestlessness, irritability\nPersistent physical symptoms that do not respond to treatment, such as headaches, digestive disorders and chronic pain.\n\nRESOURCES\nNational Institute of Mental Health, www.nimh.nih.gov (1 800-421-4211)\nNational Mental Health Association, www.

        "summary": "For information purposes, symptoms of depression include persistent sadness, anxiety, or an \"empty\" mood, coupled with feelings of pessimism, hopelessness, and worthlessness. Loss of interest or pleasure in once-enjoyed activities, along with fatigue, decreased energy, and difficulty concentrating, are common. Changes in sleep patterns, appetite, and weight may occur. Thoughts of death or suicide, irritability, and physical symptoms like headaches or chronic pain can also manifest. Depression can take various forms, such as major depression, dysthymia, or bipolar disorder. Seeking professional help, like a psychiatrist, is crucial for accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment, often involving therapy and medication.

At times, individuals may return to the deep sleep stages after an extended period, particularly if they sleep for an extended duration.

No. If you were raped, you are not a virgin. Scientifically, no. I'm sorry. But since the intercourse was not voluntary, there is no harm in considering yourself a virgin. If you have a boyfriend or fiancee or something, you wouldn't be unloyal by saying you're technically not a virgin. I'm sorry about having to suffer such a horrifying experience. If it's bothering you at all, tell someone: a good friend, Mom, counselor, or seek proffesional help. :) its not necessary that you should bleed the first time you have sex.\nyou are not a virgin.\ni'm sad to know that you had been raped when you were so young. thats sad well in my eyes and the law and god you are still a virgin.

        "input": "summarize as INFORMATION: what is spinalcord lesions? A. General comments\n\nThe complex of anatomy of the vertebral column and the great concentration of important tracts in a structure of small cross-sectional area are unique features related to spinal cord injury. A number of factors influence the severity of pathological changes and functional deficits after spinal cord trauma, including age and the flexibility of the body, the size of the bony canal as influenced by heredity, degenerative changes of joints and intravertebral discs and variations in blood supply. The spinal levels most commonly involved with injury are the lower cervical spine (C4, C5, C6, C7, T1) and the thoracolumbar juncture (T12, L1, L2), the areas of greater mobility. \n\nB. Pathophysiology\n\n1. The spinal cord and nerve roots may be injured by: \n\na. Compression from bone, ligaments, extruded disc material and tumors. \n\nb. Disruption or overstretching of neural tissues \n\nc. Edema following compression or concussion \n\nd. Disturbance of circulation \n\n\n2. Mechanisms of injury \n\n\na. Direct injury results from force applied directly to the back of the neck or trunk and may cause fractures of spinous processes of laminal arches, concussion of the spinal cord, or direct compression of neural tissue by depressed bone fragments. Lacerations can result from knife or bullet wounds. \n\n\nb. Indirect injury is a more common mechanism resulting from forces applied to the head and trunk or from movements that exceed the normal range, e.g. when the head is suddenly accelerated or decelerated in relation to the trunk. \n\nC. Pathological changes \n\nThe most common pathological changes are contusions, with necrosis, swelling and hemorrhage acutely to variable extents. Chronic changes include macrophages, gliosis and loss of architecture. In addition, edema may occur in areas that do not show contusions and infarction may result from impairment of circulation. Wallerian degeneration in distal axons will occur. \n\nD. Clinical signs\n\nNeurological symptoms vary from complete loss of function below the injured segments to temporary loss of cord function with complete recovery. Specific symptoms depend on the site of injury. e.g. posterior horn or column injury produces paresthesias, pain and other sensory disturbances; anterior horn or corticospinal tract damage results in weakness or paralysis. After denervation, fibrillations, fasciculations, muscle atrophy, and groups of atrophic fibers in a muscle biopsy will be seen. \n\nE. Types of injury\n\n1. Fracture dislocation of the spine \n\n2. Hyperextension or hyperflexion with cord compression by a displaced vertebral body fragment. \n\n3. Cervical spondylosis \n\n4. Intervertebral disc abnormalities and other osseous pathology, e.g. herniated lumbar disc \n\n5. Neoplasms (intramedullary or extramedullary) spinal cord \n\nThe spinal cord is a part of the vertebrate nervous system that is enclosed in and protected by the vertebral column (it passes through the spinal canal). It consists of nerve cells. The cord conveys the 31 spinal nerve pairs of the peripheral nervous system, as well as central nervous system pathways that innervate skeletal muscles.\n\nThe vertebral column consists of vertebrae described as belonging to 5 groups (called segments). These segments are (in order from top to bottom): the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar vertebrae, and the sacrum and coccyx",
        "summary": "For information purposes, the spinal cord's unique anatomy and concentration of vital tracts within a small cross-sectional area make spinal cord injuries distinct.

Pathophysiological mechanisms involve compression, disruption, overstretching, and disturbances in circulation. Direct and indirect injury mechanisms can result in fractures, concussions, lacerations, and disruptions of neural tissues. Pathological changes include acute contusions, chronic macrophages, gliosis, and architecture loss. Neurological symptoms range from complete loss to temporary function loss, depending on the injury site. Injuries include fracture dislocation, hyperextension or hyperflexion, cervical spondylosis, intervertebral disc abnormalities, and neoplasms.

Headache:\n\nA headache is a pain in the head with the pain being above the eyes or the ears, behind the head (occipital), or in the back of the upper neck. Headache, like chest pain or back ache, has many causes. \n\nAll headaches are considered primary headaches or secondary headaches. Primary headaches are not associated with other diseases. Examples of primary headaches are migraine headaches, tension headaches, and cluster headaches. Secondary headaches are caused by other diseases. The associated disease may be minor or major. \n\nTension headaches are the most common type of primary headache. As many as 90% of adults have tension headaches. Tension headaches are more common among women than men. \n\nMigraine headaches are the second most common type of primary headache. An estimated 28 million people in the US have migraine headaches. Migraine headaches affect children as well as adults. Before puberty, boys and girls are affected equally by migraine headaches, but after puberty more women than men have them. Migraine often goes undiagnosed or is misdiagnosed as tension or sinus headaches. \n\nCluster headaches are a rare but important type of primary headache, affecting mainly men. The average age of cluster headache sufferers is 28-30 years, although headaches may begin in childhood. \n\nSecondary headaches may result from innumerable conditions, ranging from life threatening ones such as brain tumors, strokes, meningitis, and subarachnoid hemorrhages to less serious but common conditions such as withdrawal from caffeine and discontinuation of analgesics (pain killing medication). Many people suffer from \"mixed\" headache disorders in which tension headaches or secondary headaches may trigger migraine. \n\n\nStomach ache:\n\nPain in the belly (abdomen) can come from conditions affecting a variety of organs. The abdomen is an anatomical area that is bounded by the lower margin of the ribs above, the pelvic bone (pubic ramus) below, and the flanks on each side. Although abdominal pain can arise from the tissues of the abdominal wall that surround the abdominal cavity (i.e., skin and abdominal wall muscles), the term abdominal pain generally is used to describe pain originating from organs within the abdominal cavity (i.e., beneath the skin and muscles). These organs include the stomach, small intestine, colon, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas. Occasionally, pain may be felt in the abdomen even though it is arising from organs that are close to but not within the abdominal cavity, for example, the lower lungs, the kidneys, and the uterus or ovaries. This latter type of pain is called \"referred\" pain because the pain, though originating outside the abdomen, is being referred to (felt) in the abdominal area. \n\nAbdominal pain can be acute and sudden in onset, or the pain can be chronic and longstanding. Abdominal pain may be minor and of no great significance, or it can reflect a major problem involving one of the organs in the abdomen. The characteristics of the pain--location, timing, duration, etc. are important in diagnosing its cause. Persisting abdominal pain should be evaluated by a physician.",
        "summary": "Headaches, characterized by pain in the head, encompass primary types like tension, migraine, and cluster headaches, with tension headaches being the most prevalent. Migraines affect approximately 28 million people in the US, occurring in both children and adults, while cluster headaches are rare and predominantly affect men. Secondary headaches arise from various conditions, ranging from life-threatening issues to less severe problems. Stomach ache, or abdominal pain, can originate from organs within or close to the abdominal cavity, and its characteristics, including location and duration, are vital for diagnosis.

In order to be succeed at thinning your waistline, you have to get a basic under standing of how the abdominal muscles function and how your body burns fat.\n\nThe first thing that you need to understand is the difference between fat and muscle tissue. Fat is created by eating excess calories and it is primarily stored in layers on top of your muscles. Muscle tissue consists of fibers that contract to produce movement.\n\nFat can't turn into muscle, and muscle can't turn into fat. But you can lose muscle mass while you gain fat. That's what happens to most people, especially as they begin to get a little older.\n\nSo if your goal is a trim waist line and a nice flat stomach, the first thing you need to do is remove the layers of fat that are sitting on top of your abs. Everyone has a flat stomach. It's just that some of them are covered with excess fat. \n\nThe most effective way to flatten your stomach is with a combination of strength training (placing an extra focus on the mid-section), cardiovascular exercises (short, intensive workouts), and a stable blood sugar level to keep you from adding even more fat (and it makes it easier for the body to use your body fat for fuel). \nYou have to do some type of progressive strength training. The ab muscle is primarily used to flex your torso forward. But there are also muscles that flex your torso to the side and other muscles that rotate it. Often you will see people on their ab roller every day doing lots of sit-ups or crunches. \n\nIf you want to effectively strengthen your stomach muscles you need to incorporate these exercises: \n  \n1-2 forward flexion exercises (sit-up, crunch, etc.) \n  \n1-2 side flexion exercises (side crunches, side bends, etc.) \n  \n1-2 rotational exercises (standing twists, trunk rotations, etc.)\n  \nYour abs are muscles, and just like any other muscles, they should be exercised at most 3 times per week. You also want to make sure you're training them progressively, which means working them harder each time. \n  \nIncrease metabolism using short, and hard, cardio workouts. Cardio workouts are very important because they can, if done properly, increase your metabolism for up to 24 hours or more!\n\nThis means that you're less likely to store any excess calories as body fat simply because they're more likely to be used up by your higher metabolism. Plus, you're more likely to burn off some excess body fat in the process! \n\nHere's a simple interval workout that you can do with just about any activity (bicycling, walking, swimming, etc).\n  \nWarm up at an easy pace for 2-5 minutes \n  \nPerform 30 seconds of hard exercise (almost as hard as possible) \n  \nperform one minute of moderate exercise (recovery time to catch your breath) \n  \nRepeat this process from 6-10 times \n  \nCool down at an easy pace for 2-5 minutes  \n  \nMaintaining a stable blood sugar level is the key. Most importantly, you have to stabilize your blood sugar level! This is by far the most important factor when it comes to shedding that excess body fat and keeping it off!\n\nTo stabilize your blood sugar level you have to feed your body frequently, about every 2-3 hours. The key is to give your body only the amount of food that it needs at that time. Your body burns calories all day long, so why would you only feed it once or twice a day?\n\nGive your body the fuel it needs: fruits, whole grains, vegetables, nuts, berries, and lean proteins (fish, lean beef, chicken, eggs, etc). \n\nMost people pay too much attention to how much fat is in food, or how healthy a meal is.

The disease takes its less-scientific name from Lou Gehrig, a baseball player with the New York Yankees in the late 1920s and 1930s, who was forced to retire in 1939 as a result of the loss of motor control caused by the disease. \n\nIn 1991, a team of researchers linked familial ALS to chromosome 21. Two years later, the SOD1 gene was identified as being associated with many cases of familial ALS. The enzyme coded for by SOD1 carries out a very important function in cells: it removes dangerous superoxide radicals by converting them into non-harmful substances. Defects in the action of this enzyme mean that the superoxide radicals attack cells from the inside, causing their death. Several different mutations in this enzyme all result in ALS, making the exact molecular cause of the disease difficult to ascertain.\n\nRecent research has suggested that treatment with drugs called antioxidants may benefit ALS patients. However, since the molecular genetics of the disease are still unclear, a significant amount of research is still required to design other promising treatments for ALS",

But now there's new hope thanks to a new treatment called the pillar procedure. \n\nHow the Pillar Procedure works\nThe Pillar Procedure addresses one of the anatomical components of sleep apnea and snoring: the soft palate. During the Pillar Procedure, three tiny woven inserts are placed in the soft palate to help reduce the vibration that causes snoring and the ability of the soft palate to obstruct the airway. Once in place, the inserts add structural support to the soft palate.

The recommended healthy weight loss is about 2 pounds per week, as each 3500 calories equate to 1 pound. To achieve gradual and sustainable weight loss, it's advised to consume around 1000 calories a day, ensuring a balanced intake of carbohydrates, fat, and protein based on individual factors like height and goal weight. Staying hydrated with at least 64 ounces of water daily, exercising for at least one hour four times a week, taking multivitamins, and incorporating green tea into the diet are suggested strategies.

        "input": "summarize as INFORMATION: does being cold causes a cold? A \"cold\" (runny nose, sinus drainage, sneezing, miserable feeling) is called acute rhinitis.  It's a inflammation of the mucous membranes in the nose and throat and is caused by a virus.   \n\nThere are many viruses that cause head-colds (acute rhinitis) and simply not being warm (no coat, gloves, etc) will not cause you to have acute rhinitis. You must be exposed to the virus before you can \"catch a cold.\" \n\nSneezing causes airborne particles.  Someone who sneezes and has the virus can allow you to get the a cold.  Touching someone or something that has a virus on it can cause you to get a cold (acute rhinitis).\n\nThe virus enters your body by way of your eye, nose, or mouth. \n\nHand-washing is an excellent way to minimize the chance you'll catch a cold. Both. Yes, you do get colds from airborn or surface viruses. However, your mother is right because being cold will lower your resistance and your immune system. Research has shown that being \"cold\" does not make you more susceptible to colds. I put cold in quotes because cold is a relative term.  For instance, Mom is cold at 72 degrees and that's just too hot for me.  In the research that has been done, \"cold\" is usually around 40 degrees with their feet in cold water. Even spending quite a bit of time like this, people were still no more likely to catch a cold when directly exposed to cold germs.\n\nAnother reason I point out the relativity of being cold.  This idea has been around a long, long time.  When I read books written in the 1800s, the characters will talk about breaking the ice that had formed on the bedside water pitcher.  These people were sleeping in temperatures far colder than most people in developed countries can even conceive of.\n\nStill, it does seem like people get more colds during winter. It should be noted that this is the same whether you are in Chicago or LA. \n\nIt's possible that germs like it a touch cooler than we do, or it's possible we simply stay inside more, which leads to a greater chance of being exposed to other peoples colds (also, there's a lot more travelling and socializing in November/December - yet more chances to catch a cold).  \n\nIt could be that a good number of cases of colds are just \"cold stress\" - a reaction our bodies have to sudden changes in weather.  I know that my nose will run whenever we get a cold front come through.  \n\nWe have no real data, even on whether there really are more colds in the winter.  So it's hard to tell why we get more colds during the winter.  But getting cold doesn't seem to be that much of a culprit. When you are cold, your body can't protect itself as well from illness because it turns its attention to protecting you from the cold itself.  If you wear the hat and gloves and coat, when you are exposed to germs in the air and on surfaces, you will be more able to fight it off before it makes you really ill.",
        "summary": "Experiencing a \"cold\" (acute rhinitis) is caused by a virus, and being exposed to the virus is necessary to catch a cold. Airborne particles from sneezing or touching surfaces with the virus can introduce it to the body through the eyes, nose, or mouth. Hand-washing is recommended to minimize the risk of catching a cold. While being cold itself does not directly make you more susceptible to colds, there is a correlation between colder weather and an increase in colds, possibly due to factors such as spending more time indoors and increased exposure to others' colds. Wearing appropriate clothing in cold conditions is advised for overall health and immune system support.",

An inguinal hernia occurs in the groin (the area between the abdomen and thigh). It is called \"inguinal\" because the intestines push through a weak spot in the inguinal canal, which is a triangle-shaped opening between layers of abdominal muscle near the groin. Obesity, pregnancy, heavy lifting, and straining to pass stool can cause the intestine to push against the inguinal canal.\n\nSymptoms of inguinal hernia may include a lump in the groin near the thigh; pain in the groin; and, in severe cases, partial or complete blockage of the intestine. The doctor diagnoses hernia by doing a physical exam and by taking x rays and blood tests to check for blockage in the intestine.\n\nThe main treatment for inguinal hernia is surgery to repair the opening in the muscle wall. This surgery is called herniorrhaphy. Sometimes the weak area is reinforced with steel mesh or wire. This operation is called hernioplasty. If the protruding intestine becomes twisted or traps stool, part of the intestine might need to be removed. This surgery is called bowel resection. (Bowel is another word for intestine.) Its a protrusion of abdominal content frm inguinal canal. It must be treated to prevent further complications. Another hernia is femoral hernia where the content comes frm femoral canal.

You need to eat healthy food, fruit, vegetables, whole grains,(no white bread or sugars). Starches and sugars make your pancreas produce insulin. when that happens your body starts to store fat.\nDiet and exercise together will produce the best weight loss. Exercise increases your metabolism, burning more calories. It builds muscle which also burns more calories.\nTry to eat small meals several times a day in stead of 3 large meals. The body will not think you are starving and store fat. Try the rice diet. A cup of rice at meal times, and one piece of fruit (any kind) w/each meal. It is about 1200 calories a day. Do it for a week, and you will see great weight loss. If you cheat, it will take longer naturally. Diet soda, tea is all okay. Then follow healthy eating habits or you will gain lbs. back. I fear what you really may be asking. But I agree, eating a balanced diet is that absolute best way to go. If you want to do somthing drastic, stop eating sugar all together. I lost 21pounds from not eating white flour and products with sugar content in the 4th ingrediant or higher. I didn't exsersize, but remember this it takes 1500 calories to gain or loose a pound and a calorie is a calorie so, eat foods that are nutrient dense vs. foods that are energy dence(high fat) you can eat more that way. \ncarbs(like in oatmeal, bread) and Protien(meats and cheese) have 4calories per gram of food and fat, has 9 calories per gram of food. That's twice as much calories in 1 gram of food, choose wisely. good luck.",
        "summary": "It is suggested that adopting a healthy eating regimen is crucial for effective weight management. The advice recommends incorporating nutrient-rich foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, while avoiding starches and sugars that can stimulate insulin production and lead to fat storage. The synergy of a balanced diet and regular exercise is emphasized as the most effective strategy for weight loss, with exercise boosting metabolism and muscle development. The guidance also encourages consuming smaller, more frequent meals to prevent the body from interpreting it as starvation and storing fat. An alternative approach involves the \"rice diet,\" limiting daily calorie intake to approximately 1200 calories through a cup of rice and a piece of fruit per meal, potentially resulting in significant weight loss within a week. For those seeking a more drastic measure, eliminating sugar entirely is proposed, with personal success shared in avoiding white flour and high-sugar content products.

A nurse practitioner (NP) is a registered nurse with advanced academic and clinical experience, which enables him or her to diagnose and manage most common and many chronic illnesses, either independently or as part of a health care team. A nurse practitioner provides some care previously offered only by physicians and in most states has the ability to prescribe medications. Working in collaboration with a physician, a nurse practitioner provides high-quality, cost-effective and individualized care for the lifespan of patient's special needs. NPs focus largely on health maintenance, disease prevention, counseling and patient education in a wide variety of settings. With a strong emphasis on primary care, nurse practitioners are employed within several specialties, including neonatology, nurse-midwifery, pediatrics, school health, family and adult health, women's health, mental health, home care, geriatrics and acute care. \nNurse practitioners are educated through programs that grant either a certificate or a master's degree. A registered nurse is recommended to have extensive clinical experience before applying to a nurse practitioner program. An intensive preceptorship under the direct supervision of a physician or an experienced nurse practitioner, as well as instruction in nursing theory, are key components to most NP programs. physician assistants (PAs) are non-physicians licensed to practice medicine with a physician's supervision. This supervision, in most cases, need not be direct or on site and many PAs practice in remote or underserved areas in satellite clinics. PAs can treat patients and, in most states, prescribe medicine, and in some states in the US they carry a DEA number that gives them authority to prescribe controlled medications like narcotics. PAs in surgical practices also serve as first assists in surgery. PAs provide medical services that are reimbursed under Medicare and third party insurances. Physician assistants and Nurse Practitioners both provide similar services in most states, the major distinction being that nurse practitioners are registered nurses by trade. Both are also known as Advanced Practice Clinicians (APCs) or mid-level practitioners (MLPs).",

I use Dove now and am fine.\n\nSwitch deodorants and be extra gentle to that area for the time being.  I know it will totally suck, but do not shave your armpits until the spot is healed.  Depending on the severity, you may want to see a doctor.  If it's a relatively small spot, you can probably get away with just applying an antibiotic cream (such as Neosporin) to it a few times a day.  Also, you shouldn't use deodorant on that spot either. Perhaps if it is \"burned\" you should let it heal naturely.  The outer layer of skin is constantly being shed.  Hide your armpits until healed.  Sensitive skin may be harmed by medications not prescribed by a doctor.  Of course change deodorants too.  See a doctor if it does not clear up soon.

By placing the left hand under the left side of the pelvis and allowing the neck to hang to the right, individuals gradually shift their weight to the right side, applying pressure with the left hand to encourage a controlled stretch. Deep breathing is incorporated to enhance the stretch, emphasizing expansion of the neck with each inhale. The goal is to create more space between the left ear and shoulder as the head hangs to the right. After holding this position for 5-15 breaths, individuals slowly return to the center, maintaining the head's rightward position, and then proceed to repeat the stretch on the right side. The exercise concludes by using the right hand to gently guide the head back to the center without engaging the neck muscles.

Testicular cancer is one of the most common cancers in young men between the ages of 15 and 35, but the disease also occurs in other age groups, so all men should be aware of its symptoms. While testicular cancer is common among young men, young men typically do not develop any kind of cancer, so overall, testicular cancer is a relatively rare disease. This form of cancer is almost always curable if it is found early. Most testicular cancers are found by men themselves, either as a painless lump, a hardening or change in size of the testicle, or pain in the testicle. Children born with an undescended testicle have an increased risk of getting testicular cancer, regardless of whether surgery is done to correct the problem. However, the surgery should still be done to preserve fertility. The theory is that the increased risk of testicular cancer is due to whatever caused the undescended testicle, not just by the fact that the testicle was undescended. Common symptoms include a swelling and/or lump in one or both of the testes, a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum, and a dull feeling of pain in the region of the lower abdominal area, groin, or lower back. Pain in the testes or scrotum may or may not be present. No touching your balls mister...I've got my eye on you. im pretty sure bumps on the testicles",

While pain in the testes or scrotum may or may not be present, it's crucial to be aware of any unusual bumps on the testicles. Testicular cancer is more prevalent in young men aged 15 to 35 but can occur in other age groups, necessitating awareness of its symptoms by all men. Although relatively rare, testicular cancer is highly curable if detected early. Men often discover it themselves through the identification of painless lumps, changes in testicle size, or testicular pain. Individuals born with an undescended testicle face an increased risk of testicular cancer, emphasizing the importance of corrective surgery to preserve fertility. The elevated cancer risk is attributed to the underlying cause of the undescended testicle, not solely its undescended state.",

Thirst is often associated with a dry unpleasant-tasting mouth and the feeling of a need to obtain water; it can result from dehydration, decreased vascular volume, dry mouth, pharmacologic agents, or inappropriate activation of the thirst mechanism. Drinking involves the motor activities that culminate in ingestion of liquids. Thirst sensation and drinking are influenced by many factors, including the temperature and taste of a liquid. Thirst may be discomforting in persons with limited fluid intake, diminished in some elderly persons, and inappropriate in persons who are compulsive water drinkers. Although nurses are commonly confronted with client complaints of thirst, there has been minimal nursing research that relates to assessment of thirst and drinking behaviors, nursing diagnoses for thirst, or nursing interventions for persons with altered thirst or drinking behaviors.\n\nThirst is the sensation indicating the body's need for water. Dry or salty food and dry, dusty air may induce such a sensation by depleting moisture in the mucous membranes of the mouth and throat. Relief through ingestion of water is only temporary, however, if thirst results from a generalized depletion of water in the system. About three fourths of the body is composed of fluids, and the average adult requires 21/2 qt (2.4 liters) of fluid per day, supplied by water, other beverages, and foods. Depriving the body of water interferes with its metabolism and functions, causing dehydration, which is eventually fatal. The unnatural thirst that accompanies fever, diabetes, and other disorders is caused by a rapid reduction of the body fluids. The sensation of thirst is controlled by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus in the brain. Dehydration of the cells triggers the posterior pituitary to releast the antidiuretic hormone (ADH). To put it simply, you loose water, it concentrates your blood and your brain detects this concentration (osmolality) and sends a signal to drink and to also limit excretion of water.  Its caused by the salt concentration of our blood as sensed by the brain.  IF you are thirsty, you are 1% dehyradted.",

        "input": "summarize as INFORMATION: when the power of pregnancy of a mature female is most active? I just answered another VERY similar question in the pregnancy section, so I'll just repost it here, verbatim.\n\nTaken from http://www.ovulation-calculator.com/conception.htm\n\nUnderstanding how the menstrual cycle functions - and what happens during ovulation - is key to the successful prediction of ovulation. But what happens exactly? Let's look at the dynamics of fertility and conception.\n\nDuring your menstrual cycle, there are far more infertile days than fertile days. The fertile days are days when there is a possibility for conceiving. However, within your fertile period - the window of opportunity for conception - there are days of \"peak fertility\". Identifying these peak times, and planning accordingly, can help maximize your chances of becoming pregnant.\n\nThe Dynamics of Fertility\nA woman's fertile period during her menstrual cycle, on average, lasts about 9 days. The most fertile period consists of the few days before ovulation. There are a number of reasons why this is the most fertile time. First of all, the amount of cervical fluid increases - and the consistency of the mucus changes substantially (from being sticky and cloudy to becoming transparent, white, and slippery). The purpose of this change is to create a healthy medium for the sperm to survive and travel in. Given a fertile environment, sperm can live several days. The egg, on the other hand, can live only 24 hours - so timing is important. At the moment of ovulation, the body temperature begins to rise to create a warmer, more hospitable environment for a fertilized egg. Also, the cervix will start to rise, soften, and begin to open up.\n\nHormones and Ovulation: The Release of the Egg\nDuring ovulation, a number of different hormonal changes take place. Early in the menstrual cycle, a hormone called Follicle Stimulating Hormone - or FSH - enables your ovaries to nurture eggs. Within the ovaries, follicles house each individual developing egg. The follicles that hold the eggs will secrete estrogen. As the menstrual cycle progresses, the follicle containing the developing egg moves toward the surface of the ovary. Immediately before ovulation, the follicle begins secreting estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen helps the uterine lining thicken and expand, and increases blood flow to the uterus. Progesterone causes the glands of the uterine lining to form secretions that help nourish a fertilized egg.\n\nOvulation\nBy definition, ovulation is the process of an ovary releasing an egg from the follicle - permitting the egg to float down the fallopian tubes. On average, the first phase of the menstrual cycle last two weeks. Directly prior to ovulation, another hormonal change takes place - the LH Surge. LH (or Luteinizing Hormone) is the hormone that actually facilitates ovulation: it causes the egg to separate from the ovarian surface. Ovulation predictor tests function by detecting this LH Surge, thus alerting the woman that ovulation is about to take place.\n\nOnce released from the ovaries (post-ovulation), the egg can survive for about 24 hours. This means that sperm (which can live several days) must be present to fertilize the egg. Following ovulation, the egg enters the fallopian tubes and continues toward the womb. Typically, conception - the uniting of the egg and the sperm - will take place in the fallopian tube, and then the fertilized egg will continue its passage to the uterus and implant in the uterine wall. For pregnancy to take place, fertilization of the egg must be followed by a successful implantation.\n\nFollowing ovulation, the luteal phase begins, marked by an increase of the hormone progesterone, which strengthens the uterine lining (endometrium) and causes the body temperature to increase, facilitates changes in the cervical fluid, and alters the position of the cervix.\n\nWithin 24 hours, if the egg has not been fertilized, it will simply disintegrate after reaching the uterus. Without fertilization - and i Let's vote!",
        "summary": "For information purposes, during the menstrual cycle, there are more infertile days than fertile days, with the most fertile period lasting about 9 days. The peak fertility days occur just before ovulation when hormonal changes lead to increased cervical fluid, a rise in body temperature, and changes in the cervix's position. Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) nurtures developing eggs in the ovaries, and estrogen and progesterone secretions from follicles prepare the uterus for a fertilized egg. Ovulation, triggered by Luteinizing Hormone (LH) surge, releases an egg that can survive for about 24 hours. For conception, sperm must be present during this time. Following ovulation, the luteal phase begins with increased progesterone, preparing the uterus and causing temperature changes. If the egg remains unfertilized, it disintegrates within 24 hours. Understanding these dynamics can help maximize the chances of conception.",

TSH is released in response to the levels of T3 and T4 hormones from the thyroid gland. The accepted range for a healthy thyroid has changed over time. Contrary to a previous assertion, 0.2 is considered the appropriate TSH measurement for a normally functioning thyroid.

Most of the time, this occurs when new blood vessels grow through cracks in tissue layers beneath the retina called Bruch's membrane. As CNV progresses, the abnormal vessels may leak fluid and bleed.  Eventually this process causes damage to the overlying retina. Decreased and/or distorted vision will often occur. As for the cause in a newborn, I would guess that it would be an inherited eye disease. I think that you mean CMV, cytomegalovirus. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a virus related to the herpes virus group of infections. Like herpes, it is inactive at times, but it is incurable and is a life-time infection. CMV may be passed from a mother to her baby during pregnancy and is the most common congenital viral infection. It is also called congenital cytomegalovirus or cytomegalovirus inclusion disease. CMV without symptoms is common in babies and young children. It is found in saliva, urine, semen, and other body fluids. The virus is easily spread in households and in daycare centers. It can be transmitted to the fetus during pregnancy and to the baby during delivery or in breast milk.\n\nOver half of women of childbearing age become infected with CMV at least six months before becoming pregnant. There appear to be few risks for complications of CMV for this group and only a few babies have the infection at birth. These babies appear to have no significant illness or abnormalities.\n\nAbout 90 percent of babies who are infected with CMV have no symptoms at birth. But as many as 15 percent of these babies develop one or more neurological abnormalities \u2014 such as mental retardation, learning disabilities, hearing or vision loss \u2014 usually in the first year or two of life. Congenital CMV infection is a leading cause of hearing loss in children.\n\nAbout one in 1,000 babies (about 4,000 babies each year) shows symptoms of CMV at birth. These symptoms may include an enlarged spleen or liver, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), and a distinctive rash. Up to 20 percent of these babies die, and about 90 percent of the survivors suffer from serious neurological defects, such as mental retardation.\n\nAt present there is no treatment that can halt or reverse the effects of congenital CMV. However, doctors are investigating whether a new antiviral drug called ganciclovir \u2014 which is used to treat adults with AIDS who have CMV-related eye infections \u2014 also may help babies with congenital CMV.",

They form spores that allow them to survive in a dormant state until exposed to conditions that can support their growth.",
        "summary": "Clostridium botulinum is a bacterium known for producing the potent toxin botulin, leading to the rare but serious paralytic illness called botulism. First identified in 1896 by Van Ermengem, this rod-shaped bacterium thrives in low-oxygen environments and forms spores that allow it to remain dormant until conditions suitable for growth arise. There are three main types of botulism: foodborne, caused by consuming foods with the botulinum toxin; wound botulism, resulting from a wound infected with Clostridium botulinum; and infant botulism, caused by ingesting spores that grow in the intestines and release toxin.",

        "summary": "For information purposes, the likelihood of a child getting bird flu from a bird is very low. The virus is primarily found in avian feces, and the risk increases with greater exposure to bird feces. The media has exaggerated the threat of bird flu, emphasizing that it is more common in regions where people live closely with birds, such as in certain parts of Asia. Bird flu is challenging to spread through the air and does not typically transmit from human to human. The novelty of new strains makes it newsworthy, as individuals lack natural immunity. Getting a flu shot is not a guarantee of protection, as the World Health Organization predicts common strains for the annual vaccine, but there are numerous strains. Viruses can exchange genetic material, and if bird flu gained the ability to spread through the air and between people, it could pose a significant threat.

        "input": "summarize as INFORMATION: Why was Eric, the Phantom of the Opera so thin, ugly and smelt of death and had yellow eyes? Some disease? hey i read this somewher, that matches the symptons here:\n\nPFIC (Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis)\nWhat is Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC)\n\n\nTaken word for word, it means: Progressive: tending to get worse over time; Familial: passed down to a child from the parents by way of the genes; Intrahepatic: involves disease inside the liver and not the bile ducts outside the liver; Cholestasis: means poor bile flow and build-up of substances in the liver that should be put into bile. \n\n\nThe symptoms of PFIC\n\nFIC1 and BSEP disease cause similar symptoms; together they are called low-GGT PFIC because of a blood test (GGT) that is low rather than high as in most other forms of cholestasis.\n\n These diseases cause cholestasis that begins in early childhood, with the average age at onset being 3 months. However, some patients do not get symptoms of cholestasis until they are teenagers or young adults. These diseases can progress quickly to bad scarring of the liver (cirrhosis) in the first year of life or more slowly with minimal scarring well into the teenage years. Few patients have survived beyond 20 years without treatment. \n\nItching (pruritus) is the main symptom of cholestasis in many patients. Pruritus is often out of proportion to the level of jaundice (yellow eyes or skin), which is often low-grade and can wax and wane. Scratching starts as digging at the ears and eyes, which are the first areas to show bleeding and scarring. The itching may be very disabling and does not usually respond to medications. The scratching interferes with normal activities and sleep and may interfere with learning and schoolwork. \n\nProblems with growth are another major feature of PFIC. Almost all patients are short for their age, but they may not be thin. Delayed puberty and sexual development is common. Patients who are treated can have normal sexual development and several have given birth to normal children. \n\n\nOther common problems include frequent nosebleeds and wheezing. Fat-soluble vitamin (A, E, D and K) deficiencies are common in untreated patients. \n\nVitamin A deficiency can lead to problems with vision. \n\nVitamin E deficiency can lead to problems with balance, strength and coordination. Vitamin D deficiency can lead to poor bone formation. \n\nVitamin K deficiency can lead to bleeding problems. For these reasons, most patients need extra vitamins. Up to a third of patients have gallstones. Most patients have an enlarged liver or enlarged spleen. \n\nAlthough similar, there are differences between patients with BSEP disease and those with FIC1 disease. For example, patients with FIC1 disease are more likely to have watery diarrhea, which can be severe, especially after liver transplantation. However, there is much that we do not yet know about these differences and this will only become clear as more patients are studied.\n\nPatients with PFIC but with high serum GGT have been called PFIC3, and are now called MDR3 disease. These patients have very bad cholestasis in the first year of life, which may progress in the first few years of life toward failure of the liver to do its normal functions. However, there are probably less severe forms of MDR3 disease that cause milder disease. The child and his family may first become aware that there is something wrong during school age or adolescence. Sometimes, problems may not appear until adulthood. The full spectrum of liver problems caused by MDR3 disease is just now becoming known.",
        "summary": "Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC) is a genetic disorder characterized by worsening cholestasis, a condition involving poor bile flow and the accumulation of substances in the liver. PFIC can be categorized as low-GGT PFIC when associated with FIC1 and BSEP diseases, leading to symptoms such as jaundice, itching (pruritus), and liver scarring (cirrhosis). Onset typically occurs in early childhood but can manifest later into adolescence or adulthood. Itching, often disproportionate to jaundice levels, is a prominent symptom and may be resistant to medications. Growth issues, delayed puberty, frequent nosebleeds, and vitamin deficiencies are common. Patients may also experience gallstones, an enlarged liver, and spleen. PFIC3, now referred to as MDR3 disease, involves severe cholestasis in early life and may progress to liver dysfunction. Variations in symptoms exist between FIC1 disease and BSEP disease, and MDR3 disease may present with milder forms. The understanding of these disorders is evolving as more patients are studied.",

A few things to try:\n\nChamomile tea, followed by a lavendar inscence, or candle.\n\nOrange blossom tea, followed by perhaps a soothing wite tea candle/scent.\n\n2 very good methods i use.\n\nAnother good combination, which helps in breathing, ect would be a mixture of Lavendar and Camphor inscence chased with a lavendar or orange blossom tea. \n\nWhite Tea straight is a bit harsh to drink, but mixed with milk and honey tastes wonderful, and is quite calming.\n\nDont forget that you need to have a scent while you sleep if you find it hard to sleep.  Don't also to forget that a completly dark room will keep you awake, leave some light filtering into the room, not on you, but indirectly.\n\nAlso, ensure that your beddings are clean, and that the room is at a moderate temprature, not too hot, not too cold :)  It is best to keep a mild breeze, from say a ceiling fan on low, or a regular fan on low pointed away from the bed.  Keep the air indirectly on your sleeping space, it keeps your mind calm, as you focus unconciously while you sleep on the air flow.\n\nSome good tips for ya :) Good eating habits, excersize, and Melatonin.  You can get it across the counter. Chamomile tea is excellent for this!  I usually can drop off within 15 minutes of a nice steamy cup.\n\nYou may also want to try L-ornithine.  It is an Amino Acid.  You can find this at any natural food store. \n\nBut as always....first check with your doctor or any other source you trust to make sure these products are right for you.\n\n:)\nPeace!

        "input": "summarize as INFORMATION: how long does it take to see definition in body muscles after starting a diet and exercise program? How Soon Can You Expect to See Results?\n\nThe Most Frequently Asked Question of Any Beginner\n\nDo you ever wonder why so many people join a gym in January and then it\u2019s business as usual the end of February or mid-March?  There\u2019s a couple of reasons.  \n\nFirst, working out is something you do as a habit.  Not just something you do for four weeks.  Many of the people, who join up, have no idea what\u2019s going on.  They just sign up.  Hand over a year\u2019s worth of dues and get on a machine.  The lucky ones get a 30 minute overview of the gym with a personal trainer.  And maybe the trainer is good.  And maybe not.  They have somewhat of a goal.  Lose weight.  Get bigger.  And they don\u2019t have any idea of what their body can do.  After about 4-8 weeks of this, it\u2019s old.  Not exciting anymore.  They don\u2019t really like exercising anyway.  Now going to the gym is a chore that ranks with paying bills.  The excuses start (have to work late, pick up the kids, my <insert body part> hurts, I\u2019m tired) and it\u2019s over.  \n\nSecond, if you don\u2019t see results fast and I mean FAST, it\u2019s over.  If you don\u2019t lose 60 lbs in 4 weeks, then working out has failed you.  If you didn\u2019t gain 40 lbs of muscle in a month, then you are a hardgainer and will be doomed to lead the life of a skinny guy forever.  There\u2019s a whole group of people that want to obtain a certain body image.  But 16 years is way to long.  They want to be slim and trim or big and buff in 2 months for some occasion.  Or maybe they saw all the ads over the holidays, looked at themselves and said, yeah why not.  I\u2019ll just join a gym.  Fitness is easy.  Nothing to it.  I\u2019ll do a little here and there.  I\u2019ll do cardio.  I\u2019ll quit eating.  \n\nThey quit too.\n\nSo just how soon can you expect to see results?  \n\nOn average, if you change your diet, follow a moderate to intense routine and introduce some interval training cardio, you will see results in as little as 4-6 weeks.  Nothing earth shattering mind you but changes.  Slow progress.  You might even start to feel internal body changes within a week.\n\nThe key to getting the results you want as fast as possible is to monitor where you are now, where you want to be then and what you are going to do daily to get there.  \n\nThose that think results only come at the gym really never see results.  And they quit.\n\nThose that understand fitness is 24x7x365, will see results in 4-6 weeks.  When you wake up and eat breakfast or don\u2019t eat, that is fitness.  When you consistently don\u2019t get the rest you need, that is affecting your goals.  When you have no way to measure progress, it\u2019s very difficult to tell if you are going anywhere at all.  \n\nJust because you cannot \u201csee\u201d something does not mean it\u2019s not there.  Every time you pick up a weight or get on the cardio machine, jog or run, you are making changes in your body.  You might not see it but I bet you can feel it.\n\nBottom line, there\u2019s no magical number of when you might see some progress of your efforts but on average, in four to six weeks you can begin to see your efforts pay off if you understand that fitness is a lifestyle and not just another diet or thing you do when you have the time.",
        "summary": "Many individuals join gyms in January but often lose interest by February or March due to various factors. For some, working out needs to become a habitual part of their lifestyle, not just a short-term commitment. Many newcomers lack a clear understanding of fitness goals, engaging in routines without proper guidance or realistic expectations. The pursuit of rapid, dramatic results and a desire for a specific body image within a short timeframe contribute to high dropout rates. Fitness progress typically takes time, with visible changes appearing in 4-6 weeks through consistent efforts in diet, intense workouts, and interval training. Understanding that fitness is a 24/7 lifestyle involving factors beyond the gym, such as diet, rest, and daily commitment, is crucial for achieving long-lasting results.",

It is most obvious in the skin; however, the gastrointestinal tract, the respiratory, renal, cardiovascular, and genitourinary systems, as well as numerous vascular structures, are involved frequently. The symptoms result from progressive tissue fibrosis and occlusion of the microvasculature by excessive production and deposition of types I and III collagens. Other macromolecules found in the connective tissue (eg, glycosaminoglycans, tenascin, fibronectin) also are increased. The vascular alterations show a predilection for affecting the small arteries, arterioles, and capillaries. The small vessel cytoskeleton is affected by structural defects that lead to collapse. Next, the tight junctions become altered and are no longer functional, allowing the endothelium to slip into the vessel lumen.\n\nFrom webmd:  Scleroderma (pronounced SKLEER-oh-der-ma) is Greek for hard skin. It's classified as both a connective-tissue disorder and a rheumatic condition. In scleroderma, the skin gradually tightens and thickens or hardens. It loses its ability to stretch.

The \"good news\" about Paget's disease is that it is usually a \"curable cancer\". However, most cases of scaling and burning of the nipple are due to benign conditions which can be easily confused with Paget's disease.\n\nMaking the Diagnosis:\nThe major goal of this section is to help women (and their physicians) detect the early nipple changes associated with Paget's disease, and to help differentiate them from benign conditions. Making the diagnosis of Paget's disease is actually quite easy. We use a simple skin punch biopsy technique to remove a small piece of tissue from the area of the nipple with the abnormal changes. This procedure takes a few minutes to perform under local anesthesia and is painless. A small amount of skin and underlying tissues is removed and sent to the pathologist. In our experience with hundreds of cases it has proven to be 100% accurate. \n\nThe first step in evaluating any patient with a change in the skin of the nipple is to obtain a careful history and to perform a careful breast examination, followed by a diagnostic mammogram. When performing a diagnostic mammogram the mammographer is informed about the posibility Paget's disease. Special films look for fine calcifications behind the nipple. If the mammogram is negative and our clinical suspicion is low, we usually suggest that the patient place a cortisone cream on the nipple for two weeks. \n\nIf the condition has not responded completely to treatment in two weeks, we proceed to a skin punch biopsy.

Drink a lot of it! runny nose not sure but a cough at night u can put vicks on your feet and put a pair of socks on and it helps ALOT! Take NyQuil the nonstop caugh may be tonsoildice, and caughing to much may sort of unclog your nose. If the caugh is non stop, go the the hospitle NOW",
        "summary": "To alleviate cold symptoms, recommendations include getting ample rest, staying hydrated, gargling with warm salt water or using throat sprays/lozenges for a sore throat, and using petroleum jelly for a raw nose. Pain relievers like aspirin or acetaminophen can be taken for headaches or fever. Decongestants like Robitussin DM or NyQuil are suggested for managing coughs and runny noses. Additionally, using Vicks on feet and wearing socks at night can alleviate nighttime coughing. However, persistent coughing may indicate a serious condition like tonsillitis, and immediate medical attention is advised in such cases.",

It is usually called something else, like ketoprofen, and can be made with a topical pain-reliever such as bupivicane (like lidocaine).  Keep in mind your doctor may not have heard of it, and that it has to be compounded.  Check your phonebook for local compounding pharmacies so that you can give your doctor their phone number. Typically the cream comes as 10-20% active, which is possible because it will never be in your stomach to cause problems.  Unfortunately, because it has to be compounded, your insurance company will probably not cover it in the same way as regular drugs.  You may be looking at paying $50 for a 4oz jar. \n\nWhen you apply- be sure to really rub and massage the cream into your hands hard for 5-10 minutes.  This will help just as much as the ibuprofen will, because the muscle work will greatly increase blood flow to the area.  Together, massage and anti-inflammatory therapy can provide great relief.\n\nResults vary with patient.

He/she can give you the best advice on how and whether to do it. Because of its very short half-life, venlafaxine/ effexor should be discontinued gradually over at least 2 weeks. If venlafaxine/ effexor is suddenly discontinued, a withdrawal syndrome involving fatigue, nausea, dizziness, headache, insomnia, and nervousness may develop. This is one drug you do NOT want to stop taking without the guidance of your Dr.People have developed brain shivers and worse from stopping it incorrectly.\nPlease give your Dr a call and ask him/her about the safest way to discontinue this drug.",
        "summary": "For information purposes, abruptly discontinuing venlafaxine (Effexor) can lead to withdrawal symptoms due to its short half-life. It is recommended to taper the medication gradually over a period of at least two weeks to minimize the risk of a withdrawal syndrome. Symptoms of withdrawal may include fatigue, nausea, dizziness, headache, insomnia, and nervousness. This underscores the importance of a gradual and supervised approach when discontinuing venlafaxine to manage potential withdrawal effects.",

No. Our teeth (I'm referring to humans) are brachydont; that is, they only grow for a limited period and afterwards the roots of the tooth become closed. This means that there will be no new materials added, and they will become more and more worn. However, enamel is the hardest tissue in our entire bodies, so normally it doesn't wear off completely during a lifetime.\nOther mammals have ever-growing teeth; in that case both enamel and dentine are replaced constantly.\n_________________\nStreamcat, I hope you're joking. And I thought the question referred to a natural process. Of course dentists can replace enamel with synthetic materials.\n-----------------\nCan certain animals grow new enamel? Yes, but not in the sense of \"repairing\" their teeth. It's more simple than that: the distal part of the tooth (the functional end) is continually being worn, and the new tissues arise from the basal parts. Those are hypsodont teeth (as rodent incisors and the molars of many herbivores). If you get the chance to examine a rodent skull, you'll see that their incisors don't really have roots, they look like long curved cylinders with an open base. How do those animals do that? If we are smarter than animals should'nt we be able to figure out how to do that? The apical foramen may be small, but its not closed. Fillings are just a patch, I would'nt consider them to replace enamel. Let's say there is carious lesion on the surface of a tooth.  If it is deep into the dentin, then there's no going back.  However, if the lesion is just on the surface of the enamel, it can be restored. No, but human teeth can grow some new dentin in a spot where decay has reached the pulp. Can certain animals grow new enamel?",
        "summary": "No, human teeth cannot grow new enamel. Our teeth are brachydont, meaning they only grow for a limited period, and the roots eventually close. The enamel on human teeth does not regenerate or grow back. Once the enamel is worn or damaged, it cannot be naturally replaced. Dentists can use synthetic materials for enamel replacement or restore teeth with fillings, but this is not a natural growth process.

My wife's aunt lost her insurance and got free insulin from them. There are various resources that you can probably consult to get assistance in paying for your diabetic supplies / insulin. A good starting point would be your local department of health location or local social services office. Both locations should be able to refer you to the appropriate program or service to meet your needs. Your local health department (depending on where you live) may also have what is known as a \"pharmacy access\" or \"pharmacy assistance\" program. These programs are in place to assist individuals of limited means access the necessary medications and pharmaceutical supplies to treat their medical conditions. \nThere are probably several other resources you might consider contacting. Many Red Cross chapters offer such assistance, as well as private medical practices and even church groups. Don't be afraid to ask your primary care doctor or diabetic specialist for assistance in securing resources for this problem. Also, consider doing an internet search and check out some of the major pharmaceutical companies (Bayer, Abbott, etc.) Maybe they offer assistance as well. I am sure help is out there for you. \nBest of luck in your search... Generic insulin is fairly cheap, so if you really can't afford it, you are probably eligible for medicaid in your state.  However, Eli Lilly and Sanofi-Aventis are two drug companies that make insulin.  They probably have assistance programs, and if your income is below a certain level (usually 2x poverty) you would qualify for free drug.  Ask your doctor for the forms.

A diet without carbohydrates.  A no carb diet is probably a bad idea, but low-carb diets have been very popular in recent years.\n\nAs with any diet, it works best if you eat sensible portions and exercise. Low carb diets are based on the premise that a diet very low in carbohydrate leads to a reduction in the body's insulin production, resulting in fat and protein (muscle) stores being used as its main energy source Foolishness. Carbs are not necesarily bad for you unless you get the type that is. You must look up waht not eat or ask your doctor, or a nutritionist. Low carb diet\u201d (also called \u201creduced carbohydrate\u201d or \u201ccontrolled carbohydrate\u201d) is a broad term, encompassing many popular diet books (examples: Atkins, South Beach, Zone, Protein Power, Sugar Busters, Carbohydrate Addicts Diet) as well as eating plans that don\u2019t follow a rigid format, but advise limiting the consumption of foods with a lot of carbohydrate. Some diets limit the amount of overall carbohydrate, while others focus on certain types of foods, generally ones high in starch and sugars, such as the \u201cNo White Foods\u201d approach. Still others focus on how glycemic the diet is.\n\nIt\u2019s important not to equate \u201clow carb\u201d with the very low carb phase of some popular diets. These phases are usually meant to be quite short, with more carbohydrate phased in after that. Other diets begin at a higher level of carbohydrate, but still less than the USDA Food Pyramid suggests. Any diet whose primary focus is the reduction of carbohydrate in any way is what is meant by \u201clow carb\u201d on this site. In terms of percentages, since the usual \u201cmainstream\u201d recommendation is a diet with 50-65% calories from carbohydrate, I consider a diet with 40% or less energy from carbs a \u201clow-carb diet\u201d, though most of them don\u2019t measure it in this way. The natives in Alaska, I think their called the Inuit, live off of only meat which has no carbs. Though this diet doesn't seem to fair well with most others accustomed to a eurasian diet.

The substances involved in make them are hard on your system, your heart in particular. Most pills are primarily a apetite suppresent and a non-drowsy substance, like caffeine. In large quantities these can internaly damage you and put you at higher risk for heart attack.\n\nIf you want to lose weight, start by slowly eliminating calories from your diet while maintaining a healthy balance of all food types and slow increase your exercise until you are exercising at least 30 minutes a day 3 days a week. You would be severely risking your health by doing so. There is only one way to lose weight: the calories you take in every day must be less than the calories you burn every day. The fastest that you can safely lose weight is about 1.5 lbs per week. Any faster than that and whatever you are doing is not healthy. Get off the pills, start eating smaller, healthier meals consisting of natural foods, and get more cardiovascular exercise. Well i will suggest, you better walk, run, exercise (for your abs etc), all this will help you to burn fat and you have to be chossy while eating. I know and i have seen ppl eating fris and diet coke, so if you want to reduce calories don't eat fried and junk food. Eat healthy food and exercise are the best solution to reduce your weight.",

Avian influenza (also known as bird flu, avian flu, influenzavirus A flu, type A flu, or genus A flu) is a flu due to a type of influenza virus that is hosted by birds, but may infect several species of mammals. It was first identified in Serbia Montenegro in the early 1900s and is now known to exist worldwide. A strain of the H5N1-type of avian influenzavirus that emerged in 1997 has been identified as the most likely source of a future influenza pandemic and is known to have infected 133 people in Asia since late 2003, killing 68.[1]\n\nThe avian influenza subtypes that have been confirmed in humans, ordered by the number of known human deaths, are: H1N1 caused Spanish flu, H2N2 caused Asian Flu, H3N2 caused Hong Kong Flu, H5N1, H7N7, H9N2, H7N2, H7N3. Bird Flu \nHundreds of thousands of birds in Asia died due to a virus that has been dubbed the \"bird flu.\" The highly contagious illness is responsible for wiping out large numbers of poultry in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. The particular strain of influenza which has been reported as causing the deaths is called H5N1. Humans can contract the disease through close contact with infected birds, or with the feces of infected birds. It is not known to spread through human-to-human contact. There has been no indication that humans would get the disease through eating eggs or meat of sick birds.\n\nThe only known way to eradicate the disease is by culling infected flocks. Thus far millions of chickens, ducks and other kinds of poultry have been culled in an effort to eliminate the virus. There have been several deaths due to the flu and the World Health Organization has expressed concern that the virus could latch on to a human influenza virus, potentially causing a serious epidemic. The bird flu's symptoms in humans include fever and coughing and eventual pneumonia.",
        "summary": "For information purposes, avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, is caused by influenza viruses hosted by birds but capable of infecting various mammal species. Originating in Serbia Montenegro in the early 1900s, it has become a global concern. The H5N1-type, identified in 1997, is a potential source of a future influenza pandemic and has caused numerous human infections in Asia, resulting in significant fatalities. Avian influenza subtypes in humans include H1N1 (Spanish flu), H2N2 (Asian Flu), H3N2 (Hong Kong Flu), H5N1, H7N7, H9N2, H7N2, and H7N3. The virus, particularly strain H5N1, has led to the death of hundreds of thousands of birds in Asia, impacting poultry in various countries. While the disease is highly contagious among birds, transmission to humans occurs through close contact or exposure to infected bird feces, with no evidence of human-to-human transmission. Eradication involves culling infected flocks, and millions of poultry have been culled to contain the virus. There is concern that the virus could potentially combine with a human influenza virus, leading to a serious epidemic. Human symptoms include fever, coughing, and, in severe cases, pneumonia.",

The aortic valve is the gateway between the left ventricle and the aorta.  This is where fresh oxygenated blood is pumped out to the entire body.  There are a variety of diseases that can require replacement of this valve, including aortic stenosis where the valve does not properly open and close, or an aortic insufficiency where the valve allows backflow of blood from the aorta back into the left ventricle of the heart.\n\nThere are two major types of aortic valve replacements - mechanical valves and biologic/tissue valves.  Mechanical valves have been around longer and subsequently have a very refined safety and efficacy profile.  The downside is that after the procedure, the patient must be put on blood thinners for the rest of their life.  Biologic/tissue valves do not need subsequent blood thinner treatment and therefore may benefit younger, generally healthy patients.  However, it has been shown that the durability of tissue valves may be lower than mechanical valves, which may require a repeat operation later in life.\n\nThere is a variation to the above procedures called the Ross procedure.  This procedure replaces the faulty aortic valve with the patient's own pulmonary valve.  The pulmonary valve is then replaced with a tissue valve.  The rationale for doing this is that more strain is put on the aortic valve and therefore having the person's own anatomy in that place is preferable to having a weaker mechanical or tissue valve.  The pulmonary valve, which only pumps to the lungs (and therefore doesn't have to pump as hard) can withstand having a tissue valve, which isn't as durable.  In addition, this approach does not require blood thinners after the operation.\n\nCurrent cardiac surgery research is trying to investigate if valve replacement can be done in a minimally invasive way using catheter devices. The aortic valve is a semilunar valve that controls blood flow from the left ventricle to the systemic system of the body.. Its only job is to close so that backflow of blood back to the left ventricle will not be attained.. If the valve is not functioning properly the person's diastolic pressure will increase which will ultimately cause a cardiac infarction. The actual replacement can be achieved, but it is a very delicate surgery because the aorta is the biggest blood vessel in the body. Usually an aortic bypass is performed.",

This approach minimizes strain on the aortic valve and avoids the need for postoperative blood thinners. Current research explores minimally invasive catheter-based methods for valve replacement.

Medical treatments for sciatica, including medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral steroids, or epidural steroid injections to help relieve the inflammation, which is usually a component of the pain. Surgery for sciatica, such as microdiscectomy or lumbar laminectomy and discectomy, to remove the portion of the disc that is irritating the nerve root.

They are excellent at analyzing xrays and will be able to determine why the sciatica is happening and will either refer out or provide treatment. Massage is also great for sciatica & a well trained massage therapist will be able to give you therapeutic exercises to help manage the pain. \n\nThe chiropractor & massage therapist will also be able to give you pointers on lifestyle changes...for sleeping postion, footwear, posture, etc.",
        "summary": "For information purposes, sciatica can be addressed through manual treatments, such as physical therapy, specific stretching and strengthening exercises, and manual manipulation like osteopathic or chiropractic manipulation, aimed at alleviating pressure on the nerve root causing the pain. Medical treatments involve medications like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral steroids, or epidural steroid injections to reduce inflammation, a common component of sciatic pain. In cases where conservative approaches fail, surgical options like microdiscectomy or lumbar laminectomy and discectomy may be considered to remove the disc portion irritating the nerve root, relieving both pressure and inflammation. However, surgery and medication are generally considered last resorts, and initial steps involve determining the cause and exploring non-invasive treatments such as chiropractic care and massage therapy. Lifestyle changes, including adjustments to sleeping position, footwear, and posture, can also contribute to managing sciatic pain.",

Look at some pics that they should have.See how they look do they look fake or real. If they don't look good go some where else.Don't just run into it and have it done. Having your breast augmented would make it impossible to breast feed if that is something you want to do in the future. No. Look the things you see on tv that people do are crazy don't go messin with your chest love your self the way you are and if somebody don't like the breast that the good Lord has givin you then politly extend your left arm lift your fingers and wave good-bye and say nice knowing ya! the real peoples like real natural things.",
        "summary": "For information purposes, the perceived benefit of breast augmentation depends on the purpose, such as correcting a defect or enhancing a normal life. Results can vary, with some fake breasts looking natural while others appear noticeably fake. The choice of where to undergo the procedure matters. It is cautioned against making drastic changes influenced by unrealistic portrayals on TV, emphasizing the importance of self-love and embracing natural features. The subjective preference of individuals, including whether guys like fake breasts, varies.",

        "input": "summarize as INFORMATION: what are the important effects of greeg tea? All tea comes from the same plant--black, green, and oolong teas all have the same parents. The difference in the teas lies in how the teas are prepared after picking. Black and oolong tea are fermented, but Green tea is not. Therefore the active constituents remain unaltered in green tea. The most important ingredient in green tea is the phytonutrient eppigallocatchin or EGCG for short. This substance is a polyphenolic compound that acts as an antioxidant.\n\nWhat does EGCG do?\nResearch has shown that these polyphenolic antioxidants protects the body against cardiovascular disease, and promote a healthy immune system. However in this new research, Professor Roger Thornley in England states, \u201cWe have shown for the first time that EGCG, which is present in green tea at relatively high concentrations, inhibits the enzyme DHFR or dihydrofolate which is a recognized, established target for anti-cancer drugs. This is the first time to our knowledge a known target for an anti-cancer drug has been identified as being inhibited by EGCG.\u201d The scientist continued by saying that EGCG is probably just one of a number of anti-cancer mechanisms in green tea.\n\nIt's also said to help reduce bad Cholestrol among many other help benefits which are still being researched. You will find several books and online claims about green tea - most of them are true but not all of them have been published in scientific journals yet because enough research has not been done yet.\n\nIn short - it's good for you! as oppossed to coffee, green tea has an alkalizing affect on the body whereas coffee is acidic. our typical diet is all ready too acidic. \njust about anything green/fruits/vegetables  helps us this way. Green tea also has a lot of antioxidants",
        "summary": "For information purposes, all types of tea, be it black, green, or oolong, originate from the same plant, with variations arising from post-harvest processing. Unlike black and oolong teas, green tea is not fermented, preserving its active constituents, notably the polyphenolic antioxidant EGCG. Research suggests that EGCG in green tea contributes to cardiovascular health, boosts the immune system, and may inhibit the enzyme DHFR, a target for anti-cancer drugs. Despite numerous claims about green tea's health benefits, not all are scientifically substantiated due to ongoing research. In general, green tea is lauded for reducing bad cholesterol, offering an alkalizing effect on the body, in contrast to coffee's acidity, and providing a rich source of antioxidants.",

There would be no life. u should drink water so u can live to see the next day it gives u moistur and celebraties eat only meat and water. it cleans out your internal systems it keeps you from de-hydryting Well someone in my family who I wont mentioned had lots of zits adn greasy face, but once they started drinking lots of water that person's face got really nice and clear and really pretty !

No birth control method is 100% effective except abstinence. It used to be thought that pregnancy couldn't occur during menstruation, which is not true. Unusually high libido may indicate hormonal changes favoring fertility. Approximately two weeks before and after a regular period, especially around day 14 (with day 1 being the first day of the period), is considered a high probability time for conception. However, any time of the month is possible, so relying solely on timing for birth control is not recommended. Day 12-18 poses a higher risk due to the viability of sperm lasting a few days.

PROPERTIES OF AFLATOXIN AND IT PRODUCING FUNGI\n\n\nReddy,S.V. and Farid Waliyar \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMany agricultural commodities are vulnerable to attack by a group of fungi that are able to produce toxic metabolites called mycotoxins. Among various mycotoxins, aflatoxins have assumed significance due to their deleterious effects on human beings, poultry and livestock. The aflatoxin problem was first recognized in 1960, when there was severe outbreak of a disease referred as \"Turkey 'X' Disease\" in UK, in which over 100,000 turkey poults were died. The cause of the disease was shown due to toxins in peanut meal infected with Aspergillus flavus and the toxins were named as aflatoxins.\n\nNatural occurrence:\n\nFood products contaminated with aflatoxins include cereal (maize, sorghum, pearl millet, rice, wheat), oilseeds (groundnut, soybean, sunflower, cotton), spices (chillies, black pepper, coriander, turmeric, zinger), tree nuts (almonds, pistachio, walnuts, coconut) and milk. \n\nPhysical and chemical properties:\n\nAflatoxins are potent toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic, immunosuppressive agents, produced as secondary metabolites by the fungus Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus on variety of food products. Among 18 different types of aflatoxins identified, major members are aflatoxin B1, B2, G1 and G2. Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is normally predominant in amount in cultures as well as in food products. Pure AFB1 is pale-white to yellow crystalline, odorless solid. Aflatoxins are soluble in methanol, chloroform, actone, acetonitrile. A. flavus typically produces AFB1 and AFB2, where as A. parasiticus produce AFG1 and AFG2 as well as AFB1 and AFB2. Four other aflatoxins M1, M2, B2A, G2A which may be produced in minor amounts were subsequently isolated from cultures of A. flavus and A. parasiticus. A number of closely related compounds namely aflatoxin GM1, parasiticol and aflatoxicol are also produced by A. flavus. Aflatoxin M1and M2 are major metabolites of aflatoxin B1 and B2 respectively, found in milk of animals that have consumed feed contaminated with aflatoxins. Aflatoxins are naturally occurring mycotoxins that are produced by many species of Aspergillus; but most notably Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. Aflatoxins are toxic and carcinogenic to animals, including humans. After entering the body, aflatoxins are metabolized by the liver to an intermediate reactive, aflatoxin M1, an epoxide. if you live in the united states, who cares?

Prescription drugs can be used effectively alone or in combination with other prescription and nonprescription medications.\n\n          o Antibiotics: Antibiotics can be effective in treating most inflammatory acne (papules and pustules). They work by killing the bacteria and also by decreasing the redness and swelling seen in the inflammatory forms of acne.\n\n                + Antibiotics may be applied to the skin in the form of gels and lotions, or by way of pills. We now know that using a combination of 2 medications together may be very effective in treating acne. Using a topical antibiotic with topical benzoyl peroxide, for example, may prevent bacterial resistance to the antibiotic. Giving an antibiotic by mouth is often needed for acne that is more extensive, red, and tender.\n\n                + Antibiotics taken by mouth can be associated with more side effects than if applied to the skin and may interact with other medicines such as birth control pills. Sensitivity to the sun can result in a \"bad sunburn\" in some people who take the antibiotic tetracycline by mouth.\n\n          o Retinoids: Medicines made from vitamin A (retinoids) are useful in treating several types of acne lesions. Topical retinoids are effective in treating the noninflammatory types of acne (blackheads and whiteheads).\n\n                + Topical retinoids (applied directly to the skin) help to open clogged pores by creating a mild peeling effect. Drying of the skin can be a frequent side effect. Oral retinoids are reserved for treating the more extensive nodular type of acne or severe inflammatory acne, which has not responded to other treatments. Oral retinoids not only have a peeling effect but also decrease the production of oil.\n\n                + They can also be associated with a number of serious side effects including birth defects in babies of wome GET PROACTIVE--IT DOES WORK I had acne for about 12 years, and it wouldn't go away inspite of the soaps, creams, lotions and antibiotics that I had used.  I got rid of acne after doing a treatment for candida.  I took herbal antifungals, lactobacillus acidophilus, and I was following an anti-candida diet. Acne takes years to get rid of. Many people right away use OTC medicine to cure it. Destorying the live bacteria on the face is a critical action. You should get rid of acne at the first sign. Chasing pimples all over your face becomes hectic but its the only way. Some people are allergic to bacteria killing medicine such as benzoyl peroxide and clindamycin. \nTry using these medicines:\n1) Differin Topical Gel\n2) Clearsal Brand Fighter.\n3) Oxy\n4) Proactiv (RISK: Increased Acne)\nRx:\n1) Adoxa (Doxycyline Tablets)\n2) Duac Topical Gel\n\nRemember, allowing more oils and creams/lotions to your face means more blockage and heat to be stored. This causes the over size pimple. Make sure you have some sort of invigorating rubbing cream. St.Ives apricot scrub is the best.\nIf else fails, seek your Physician. An expert germ physician. At young acne years, doctors might perscribe you with bacteria killing pills. This is excellent. A topical gel working on the exterior side and an bacteria killing pill working interior.",
        "summary": "Before using any medicines, It is suggested to consult a registered physician. As for acne treatment, self-care at home can include washing once or twice daily with soap and water to remove excess oil. Over-the-counter acne medications are available and can be used according to the provided directions. An acne cleanser purchased over-the-counter can also be helpful, but it's important to avoid scrubbing too abrasively, as it may irritate the skin and worsen acne.

The same could be said for alcohol and other non-prescription drugs and even some foods. absolutely you will have withdrawals.  I've been taking them for about 30 years and it is now life-threatening for me to stop.  Get off of them as soon as possible if your doctor says it's ok for you to do so. I took them for a while, then got off and there was a definite withdrawl. It's like taking all the good feelings you had about yourself and life, and flushing the toilet. It didn't happen right away, but then the medicine doesn't get out of your system right away either. That's just what happened ot me, you may be ready to get off them and have no side effect whatsoever. Everyone's withdrawl is different, I'd advise talking to your doctor about it. no your body will not long for them, but you will go through with draws...before you stop taking them all together, your doc should lower the dosage until you are off of them i had no ill effect after stopping wellbutrin for 3 years. i never much enjoyed taking them anyway.",

One person emphasizes that withdrawal is a definite challenge after taking medication for about 30 years, describing it as potentially life-threatening. Another person shares a personal experience of a noticeable withdrawal, likening it to losing positive feelings about oneself and life, with effects not occurring immediately due to the gradual elimination of the medicine from the system. On the other hand, a different individual reports having no ill effects after stopping medication for three years and expressing a lack of enjoyment in taking them.

Eating less and incorporating exercises such as push-ups can help convert the excess fat into muscle over time. It's important to note that in many cases, what appears as \"man breasts\" is primarily due to fat accumulation, and weight loss through overall body fat reduction is crucial. Specific exercises, like butterflies, can be beneficial in toning the chest area, but complete resolution may not be guaranteed, as genetic factors can play a role in this condition.
